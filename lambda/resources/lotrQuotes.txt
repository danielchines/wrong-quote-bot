He's dead. He took a little tumble off the cliff.
At last! Helm's DeepThere it is, Helm's Deep. We're safe!
This is all we could save, my lady.
Simbelmyne. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers. Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live......to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. Westu h'l. Fer'u, Th'odred, Fer'u.
They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick, cot and tree.
Pull back! Pull back!
By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand! Men of the West!
It's gone Mr Frodo. The light's passed on, away towards the North. Something's drawn its gaze.
Hold your ground! Hold your ground!
Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women! And that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground.
It's all right. Nobody panic. That was deliberate. It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time. She was a girl when they brought her father back dead. Cut down by Orcs. She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone to tend her king in growing fear. Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Make way for the king. Make way for Theoden. Make way for the king.
Our people are safe. We have paid for it with many lives.
So few. So few of you have returned.
Lord Aragorn, where is he?
What of those who cannot fight, my lord? The women and children?
Draw all our forces behind the wall. Bar the gate. And set a watch on the surround.
Helm's Deep has one weakness. Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvertat its base, which is little more than a drain.
How? How can fire undo stone?
Get them into the caves. Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children. You must fight.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now. Eomer cannot help us. I know what it is you want of me......but I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. Eomer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king.
By order of the king, the city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures. Take only what provisions you need.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
When last I looked, Theoden, not Aragorn, was King of Rohan.
No Sam. I can't recall the taste of food, nor the sound of water or the touch of grass. I'm naked in the dark. There's' there's nothing, no veil between me and the wheel of fire. I can see him with my waking eyes!
Then let us be rid of it once and for all! Come on Mr Frodo, I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you! Come on!
Look Mr Frodo, a doorway! We're almost there!
Aye! I could do that.
Clever Hobbits to climb so high! Mustn't go that way. Mustn't hurt the precious!
Did he? Did he, indeed? Good. Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us. My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor. So good Smeagol does master says so.
That's it, then.We can't get past that.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.Frodo must finish this task alone.
You swore! You swore on the precious!
He's not alone. Sam went with him.
Thank you. It's good.
Look! The gate. It's opening! I can see a way down.
I made some stew. It isn't much, but it's hot.
My uncle told me a strange thing. He said that you rode to warwith Thengel, my grandfather. But he must be mistaken.
King Theoden has a good memory. He was only a small child at the time.
I'm sorry. Please, eat.
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
You are one of the Dunedain. A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life. It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.The Northern Kingdomwas destroyed long ago.
If the wall is breachedHelm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would takea number beyond reckoning......thousands, to storm the Keep.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising. Its victory is at hand.
This night, the land will be stainedwith the blood of Rohan! March to Helm's Deep! Leave none alive!
Look. There's smoke to the south.
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods. But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.He no longer cares for growing things.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
The eagles! The eagles are coming!
What are you waiting for? Just let it go!
Yeees! Yeees! Precious! My Precious!
The Grey Pilgrim. That's what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the east.
Go on! Now! Throw it in the fire!
That horse is half mad, my lord. There's nothing you can do. Leave him.
F'ste, stille n', f'ste, stille n'. Lac is drefed, gefr'gon.
Hw't nemna' 'e? Hm? Hw't nemna' 'e? (
His name is Brego. He was my cousin's horse.
Brego. 'in nama is cynglic.
Man le trasta, Brego? Man cenich?
I was raised in Rivendell for a time. Turn this fellow free. He's seen enough of war.
Thirty three, thirty four.
I have heard of the magic of Elves......but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.You speak as one of their own.
No, no. I'm going to save you.
Come on then, come on!
You already did. Eowyn, my body is broken. You have to let me go.
That still only counts as one!
I know your face, Eowyn. My eyes darken.
I know, Mr. Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
No! No! No, master! They catch you! They catch you! Don't take it to him. He wants the precious. Always he is looking for it. And the precious is wanting to go back to him. But we mustn't let him have it.
No! There's another way. More secret. A dark way.
Why haven't you spoken of this before?
Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another wayinto Mordor?
I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
Yes. There's a path and some stairs.And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
He's been true to his word.
I knew you'd find me.
Are you going to leave me?
No Merry, I'm going to look after you.
Their pace has quickened. They must have caught our scent. Hurry!
Hands off! That shiny shirt, that's mine!
Merry! Merry it's me. It's Pippin!
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country. We Dwarves are natural sprinters. Very dangerous over short distances.
Three days and nights pursuit.No food. No rest.And no sign of our quarrybut what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
It's talking, Merry.The tree is talking.
Tree? I am no tree! I am an Ent.
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
A tree-herder. A shepherd of the forest.
Side? I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. Go back to the Shadow.The dark fire will not avail you,flame of Udun!
Don't talk to it, Merry. Don't encourage it!
It's Saruman's army. The war has started.
It's gone. It's done.
Yes Mr Frodo. It's over now.
I can see the Shire. The Brandywine River. Bag End. Gandalf's fireworks. The lights on the party tree.
Rosie Cotton dancing. She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone, it would have been her. It would've been her.
I'm glad to be with you Samwise Gamgee here at the end of all things. They hug.
No! Don't you let go! Don't let go! Reeeaaach!
Gondor is lost. There is no hope for men. Why do the fools fly? Better to die sooner than late. For die we must.
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long slow sleep of death embalmed. We shall burn like the heathen Kings of old. Bring wood and oil.
I am steward of the house of An'rion. Thus have I walked, and thus now I will sleep.
Let him go, you filth! Let him go!
You will not touch him again! Come on then, finish it!
Keep breathing. That's the key. Breathe.
They've run as if the very whipsof their masters were behind them.
You are soldiers of Gondor. No matter what comes through that gate you will stand your ground.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
Peregrin Took my lad, there is a task now to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shire folk to prove their great worth. You must not fail me.
It's been very quiet across the river.
The Orcs are lying low. The garrison may have moved out. We've sent scouts to Cair Andros. If the Orcs attack from the North, we'll have some warning.
Bad idea! Very handy in a tight spot these lads, despite the fact they're dead.
You gave us your word!
I hold your oath fulfilled. Go. Be at peace.
Hello? Treebeard? Where has he gone?
Good Smeagol always helps.
Did you hear that? There it is again. Something's not right here. Not right at all.
I had the loveliest dream last night. There was this large barrelfull of pipe-weed. And we smoked all of it. And then you were sick. I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
You just said something...Treeish.
I go to my fathers, in whose mighty company; I shall not now feel ashamed.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one. You're the short one.
Please, Merry. You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most? Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7". 3'8"!
I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!
You touch it and I'll stick this blade in your gut!
The scum tried to knife me. Kill him!
It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else.
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.
Stop your squealing you dunghill rat!
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig!
Not if I stick you first!
Oh Sam, I'm so sorry. Sorry for everything.
Let's get you out of here.
Rohan. Home of the Horse-lords. There's something strange at work here. Some evil gives speed to these creatures. Sets its will against us.
And that's for my old gaffer!
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
The Old World will burnin the fires of industry. The forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc. We have only to remove those who oppose us.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many! They cannot all be armed in time we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the streamwork the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
Hobbits? Never heard of a Hobbit before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me! They come with fire. They come with axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
The world is changing. Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron, we shall rule this Middle-earth.
Maybe you are, and maybe you aren't.The White Wizard will know.
See? See? We've led you out. Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry! Very lucky we find you. Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.
No! You don't understand. We're Hobbits! Halflings! Shire-folk!
No, no birdses to eat. No crunchable birdses. We are famished! Yes! Famished we are, precious!
I hate this place. It's too quiet.There's been no sight nor soundof a bird for two days.
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!
What does it eats? Is it tasty? It tries to chokes us! We can't eats Hobbit food! We must starve!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Oh, cruel Hobbit. It does not care if we be hungry. Does not care if we should die. Not like master. Master cares. Master knows. Yes. Precious. Once it takes hold of us, it never lets go.
Nothing.Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No! Don't look down, Sam!Just keep going!
Bogs and rope and goodness knows what. It's not natural. None of it.
Nothing. Just a bit of seasoning. I thought maybe if we was havinga roast chicken one night or something.
Oh no! Frodo, Mr Frodo. Wake up. Don't leave me here alone. Don't go where I can't follow. Wake up. Not asleep. Dead.
You get back you scum!
I think I've found the bottom.
Killed another one has she?
No. This fellow ain't dead.
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
She jabs him with her stinger and he goes as limp as a boned fish aaa' then she has her way with them. That's how she likes to feed. Fresh blood. Get him to the Tower!
You remember the Old Forest on the borders of Buckland? Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Trees that could whisper......talk to each other......even move.
I'm starving. We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah! Why can't we have some meat?! What about them? They're fresh.
The house of his spirit crumbles. He is burning. Already burning.
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.
What about their legs? They don't need those.
Get back, scum! The prisoners go to Saruman. Alive and unspoiled.
Alive? Why alive? Do they give good sport?
This scum will be awake in a couple of hours.
They are not for eating.
They have something. An Elvish weapon. The master wants it for the war.
They're not coming from the North! To the river quick, quick!
They think we have the Ring.
Ssh!As soon as they find out we don'twe're dead.
Gondor calls for aid.
And Rohan will answer! Muster the Rohirrim. Assemble the army at Dunharrow, as many men as can be found. You have two days. On the third, we ride for Gondor' and war.
Three-foot-eight. You did something.
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!
The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!
Merry! No, Treebeard said that youshouldn't have any.
The beacon! The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit.
lt could well be dangerous!
Aaagh!It's got my leg!
Away with you. You should not be waking. Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.
Go to sleep. Away with you. Come, the forest is waking up.
Give me it back. Merry!
It's too late. It's over. They've taken it Sam, they took the Ring!
It isn't safe.The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. Black are their thoughts. Strong is their hate. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Come on Mr Frodo. We'd best find you some clothes. You can't go walking through Mordor in nowt but your skin.
We did it Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor.
There are so many of them. We'll never get through unseen.
We have to go in there Mr Frodo. There's nothing for it. Come on let's just make it down the hill for starters.
Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The darkness is deepening.
I thought I'd lost you. So I took it, only for safekeeping.
Begging your pardon but they haven't.
Give it to me! Give me the Ring Sam. Sam! Give me the Ring. You must understand. The Ring is my burden. It will destroy you Sam.
It's only a matter of time. He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping.
If Sauron had the Ring we would know it.
We will fight for you.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.
Let him stay there! Let him rot! Why should we care?
We have only to remove those who oppose us. It will begin in Rohan. Too long have these peasants stood against you. But no more.
Eothain! Eothain! You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep. Burn it.
All dead. All rotten. Elves and Men and Orcses. A great battle long ago. Dead Marshes. Yes. Yes, that is their name. This way. Don't follow the lights.
Careful now! Or Hobbits go downto join the dead ones......and light little candlesof their own.
Don't follow the lights.
Listen to me. You must ride to Edorasand raise the alarm. Do you understand me?
There are dead things! Dead faces in the water.
Take back the lands they stole from you.Burn every village!
Master should be resting. Master needs to keep up his strength.
Mustn't ask us. Not its business.Gollum. Gollum.
It must be getting near teatime. Leastways it would be in decent places where there is still teatime.
We're not in decent places.
So bright. So beautiful.
Mr. Frodo! Are you all right?
It's just a feeling. I don't think I'll be coming back.
Yes you will. Of course you will. That's just morbid thinking. We're going there and back again just like Mr Bilbo. You'll see.
I think these lands were once part of the Kingdom of Gondor.
Mr Frodo? What is it?
Who is she? This woman you sing of?
Tis the Lady of L'thien. The Elf Maiden who gave her love to Beren ... a mortal.
Mr Frodo, look! The King has got a crown again.
What are they eating when they can't get hobbit?
What happened to her?
The power of Isengard is at your command
Long ago, when there was a King.
Sauron. Lord of the Earth.
Stay close young hobbits.
..and are never seen again
Your coming to us, is as the footsteps of doom. You bring great evil here!Ringbearer!
Well! Here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily! I have the eyes of a hawk, and ears of a fox!
The dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark.
It's very special, that.It's the best salt in all the Shire.
We can't leave this here for someoneto follow us down.
Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion.
It is special. It's a little bit of home.
Who's gonna follow us down here Mr. Frodo? It's a shame, really. Lady Galadriel gave me that. Real Elvish rope. Well, there's nothing for it. It's one of my knots. Won't come free in a hurry.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam, but they did.
What food have we got left?
Let me see. Oh, yes. Lovely. Lembas bread. And look! More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food, but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spiritsdoes it, Sam?
My old sword, Sting, Here, take it, take it.
Mr. Frodo? It's the Ring, isn't it?
My my old ring. Well I should very much like to hold it again, one last time.
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer. And it's the one place we're trying to get to. It's just where we can't get. Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost. I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
The Ringbearer is setting out on the quest of Mount Doom and you who travel with him, no oath nor bond is laid to go further than you will, Farewell. Hold to your purpose and may the blessings of elves, and men, and all free folk, go with you.
I'm sorry I brought this upon you my boy, I'm sorry that you must carry this burden, I'm sorry for everything
Then we are here on a common purpose, friend.
The shards of Narsil, The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand, Ah!Its still sharp, but no more than a broken heirloom
Why do you fear the past. You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself. You are not bound to his fate
He's not dead. HE'S NOT DEAD, NO! NO! He's not dead.
Farewell Peregrin son of Paladin.
I release you from my service. Go now and die and what way seems best to you.
Come on soldier, move it.
I'm a friend of Gandalf the Grey
Hurry along there, hurry along.
Gandalf! Where's Gandalf?, GANDALF!
Men of the South are welcome here
Go on. Call for help. Squeal. No one's going to save you now.
A red sun rises.Blood has been spilled this night.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!
Riders of Rohan, what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly!
Just a mouthful, a bit of the flank.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
Give me your name, horse-masterand I shall give you mine.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.This is Gimli, son of Gloinand Legolas of the Woodland Realm.We are friends of Rohanand of Theoden, your king.
You would die before your stroke fell.
Make haste across the Riddermark. Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.
Just to the encampment. It's tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men. The men have found their captain. They will follow you into battle. Even to death. You have given us hope.
Excuse me! I have a sword. Please accept it! I offer you my service Theoden King.
And gladly, I accept it. You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.
Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war. I fear war already marches on their own lands.
Now is the hour, Riders of Rohan. Oaths you have taken. Now fulfil them all, to Lord and Land! Hah!
Why are there so few of youwhen you have lived so long? Are there Ent children?
Bru-ra-hroom.There have been no Entingsfor a terrible long count of years.
Horse men! I wish I could muster an army of Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.
Die? No. We lost them. And now we cannot find them. I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan, whose mind is overthrown. Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
Be careful what you say. Do not look for welcome here.
My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord? Uncle? Will you not go to him? Will you do nothing?
No. There is still hope for Frodo. He needs time and safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth. We can give him that.
Draw out Sauron's armies. Empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.
We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy for the king, to lose his only son and heir.
Certainty of death, small chance of success, what are we waiting for?
Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait.
Long have you hunted me. Long have I eluded you. No more! Behold, the Sword of Elendil!
I don't want to leave.I don't want to go, Mama.
Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall.
Not for ourselves. But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves.
Mordor will pay for this!
These Orcs are not from Mordor.
He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don't defend our country Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie. Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gandalf told me you wereone of the river-folk.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead, when sun has failed and moon is dead!
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once. Were you? Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it? A long time ago.
Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold be travellers far from home.
Come on, Frodo. Come on!
So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position. I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting, do they?
You're in the service of the steward now. You'll have to do as you are told Peregrin Took.
Ridiculous Hobbit! Guard of the Citadel!
Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way!
There's no more stars! Is it time?
Quick! They will see us!They will see us!
It's the deep breath before the plunge.
I don't want to be in a battle. But waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse. Is there any hope Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?
There never was much hope. Just a fool's hope. Our enemy is ready. His full strength's gathered. Not only orcs, but men as well, Legions of Haradrim from the South, mercenaries from the coast, All will answer Mordor's call.
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.
What orders from Mordor my Lord? What does the Eye command?
The trees are strong my Lord. The roots go deep.
This was the great watch tower of Amon.
These are for you. Keep them close, I'm going to have a look round, Stay here.
Can I have some bacon?
Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.
He's passing into the Shadow world. He'll soon become a wraith like them.
Sam! Do you know the Athelas plant?
Govannas v'n gwennen le, Haldir o L'rien.
Look Frodo. It's Mr Bilbo's trolls.
So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves! Speak words we can also understand!
We have not had dealings with the dwarves, since the dark days.
That! was not so courteous!
Saved some for you Mr Frodo
Boe ammen veriad l'n. Andelu i ven!
Frodo, come and help an old man,How's your shoulder?
Those rain clouds might.
You bring great evil with you! You can go no further!
It's because we've been here before. We're going in circles.
Yes, I can smell it. We're not alone.
This looks strangely familiar.
What is that horrid stink? I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?
The thieves! The thieves! The filthy little thieves. Where is it? Where is it? They stole it from us! My precious! Curse them, we hates them! It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting. You've seen it before, haven't you, Gollum? Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty Elves twisted it.
Maybe he does deserve to die. But now that I see him, I do pity him.
No! That would kill us! Kill us!
We be nice to them if they be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears to do what you wants! We swears!
Mr Frodo?, Frodo! Frodo! I thought I'd lost you!
It's just something Gandalf said.
Quiet, you! It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket. Let's just tie him up and leave him.
The Fellowship awaits the Ringbearer.
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?
We must hold this course west of the Misty Mountains for forty days. If our luck holds the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us. and there are road turns east to Mordor.
You look good Pippin.
No Gimli, I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.
Gentlemen, that's enough!
The same blood flows in my veins, The same weakness
Your time will come. You will face the same evil and you will defeat it A si i-Dh'ath '-orthor, Aragorn. ' or le a ' or nin.
For the Shire. Hold him, hold him down Merry!
If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note that they're not, I'd say that we were taking the long way round. Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria. My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.
And to that I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone.
I choose a mortal life.
You cannot give me this.
It is mine to give to whom I will. Like my heart.
You said you would bind yourself to me, foresaking the immortal life of your people
We are no spies. We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain. They have taken two of our friends captive.
In a dream, I saw the Eastern sky grow dark. In the West a pale light lingered. A voice was crying, your doom is near at hand, Isildur's bane is found, Isildur's Bane.
The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits. Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small. Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive. We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Hasufel! Arod!May these horses bear you to betterfortune than their former masters. Farewell.
Look for your friends.But do not trust to hope.It has forsaken these lands. We ride north!
I understand. His passing is hard to accept. Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Hmmm, you would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. He's a herald of woe.
Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow?
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late......Theoden King.
A just question, my liege. Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman!
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind? Can you not see? Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent, your warmongering.
Warmongering?,How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, Grima? When all the Men are dead you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister. Too long have you haunted her steps.
Too much. You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
His staff! I told you to take the wizard's staff!
This order does not come from me.It comes from the king.He signed it this morning.
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and death......to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
Hurry, Hobbits.The Black Gate is very close.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old. Very old. Full of memory......and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling for it. They are calling for the precious.
You have no authority here.Your orders mean nothing.
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.I'm here.
They have feelings, my friend. The Elves began it. Waking up the trees teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.What do trees have to talk about?Except the consistencyof squirrel droppings.
Aragorn, nad no ennas
The Dead City! Very nasty place full of enemies.
Quick, quick! They will see, they will see!
Come away, come away. Look we have found it. The way into Mordor.
But we have the white wizard. That's got to count for something.
This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest. If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this city will be gone.
Gimli! Lower your axe.
He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade. This is beyond my skill to heal. He needs elvish medicine
It's six days from Rivendell! He'll never make it!
Well that's nice! That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!
Kingsfoil, aye, its a weed!
What's this? a Ranger caught off his guard?
He's not going to last. We must get him to my father.
It may help to slow the poison. Hurry!
I've been looking for you for two days. There are five wraiths behind you, where the other four are I do not know
Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im.
and the Ring?, You feel its power growing don't you. I've felt it too. You must be careful now. Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship and I fear from within.
You must trust to yourself. Trust your own strength.
Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country.
There are many powers in this world for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am and against some I have not yet been tested
Ah! The walls of Moria!
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.
Three were given to the elves. Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men. Who above all else, desire power.
Hail the victorious dead
Oh it's quite simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open, Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen! (
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears, to serve the master of the precious. We will swear on... on... the precious. Gollum! Gollum!
Yes......on the precious.....On the precious.
Yes Gimli! Their own masters cannot find them, if their secrets are forgotten!
To the Gate, to the Gate! To the Gate, the master says. Yes!
No! We won't go back. Not there. Not to him. They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!
You know the way to Mordor?
Frodo! Merry! Its Frodo Baggins!
Get off him! Frodo, are you alright?
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
Hoi! You get back here! Wait till I get this through you! Get out of my fields! You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!
Dunno why he's so upset! Its only a couple of carrots.
Sam! We're still in The Shire. What could possibly happen!
Nothing, its just a wisp of cloud.
It's moving fast, against the wind.
Crebain! From Dudland!
You've got my arm... argh!... you've got my arm
And some cabbages and those few bags of potatoes that we lifted last week. And the mushrooms the week before.
Spies of Saruman. The passage south is being watched, We must take the Pass of Caradhras
Boromir! Give the Ring to Frodo.
You cannot wield it. None of us can, The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master
Gondor has no King. Gondor needs no King.
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.
You have only one choice. The Ring must be destroyed.
Fangorn? What madness drove them in there?
Theoden, son of Thengel, too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me! I release you......from the spell.
You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey!
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
The White Wizard approaches.
You are tracking the footstepsof two young Hobbits.
I know your face. Eowyn. Eowyn. Gandalf?
I am Saruman. Or rather, Sarumanas he should have been.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...... I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
I can feel his blade.
We come to it at last. The great battle of our time.
Come away Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire. Dwarves, others of a less than savoury nature
War's brewing. The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.
Children's stories that's all that is. You're beginning to sound like that old Bilbo Baggins! Cracked he was!
Hello, Hello, Fatty Bolger, Lovely to see you, Welcome, Welcome
Go on Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.
You have the gift of foresight. What did you see?
I looked into your future and I saw death.
One by one the free lands of Middle Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of Elves and Men marched against the armies of Mordor. And on the slopes of Mount Doom they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth.
There is nothing for you here only death.
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur. Who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.
The Ring came to the creature Gollum who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him.
Victory was near. But the power of the Ring, could not be undone.
It was in this moment, that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father's sword.
So' it's a drinking game?
A Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.
Lets drink to Victory! To Victory!
Heh heh heh heh,Here, here. Raaar it's the dwarves that go swimming with little, hairy women haha.
heh heh heh, what did I say? He can't hold his liquor.
I once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves, men and orcs
Do not disturb the water.
Speak friend... and enter. What's the elvish word for friend?
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there isand pits, pits, pits. And Orcses, thousands of Orcses. And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Knock your head against these doors Peregrin Took! and if that does not shatter them and I'm allowed a little peace from foolish questions I will try to find the opening words.
This way, Hobbits. Follow me!
You're late! Our master grows impatient. He wants the Shire-rats now.
Sick, is he? Give him some medicine, boys!
My friend is sick. He needs water. Please!
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots. Saruman will have his prize. We will deliver them.
Oh! I think I've broken something
So Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras. And if that fails, where then will you go?
There is a fell voice on the air
We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan and take the west road to my city!
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!
If we cannot pass over the mountain, let us go under it! Let us go through the Mines of Moria
Moria... you fear to go into those mines.
The dwarves delved too greadily and too deep.
You know what they woke in the dark of Khazad-dûm
No! Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i 'ruith!
He's trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf! We must turn back!
Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; Nai yarvaxea rasselya; taltuva notto-carinnar!
And I suppose you think you're the one to do it!
And if we fail what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?
I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an elf!
Do you not understand that while we bicker amongst ourselves, Sauron's power grows?! None can escape it! You'll all be destroyed!
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Where is Theodred? Where is my son?
Darkness took me......and I strayed out of thoughtand time.
Gandalf? Yes. That was what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name.
I am Gandalf the White. And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
Edoras? That is no short distance!
One stage of your journey is over. Another begins. We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
Then we have run all this way for nothing? Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here, in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested-- I mean, charming, quite charming forest?
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn. A great power has been sleeping here for many long years. The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
Well it's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders. Keep your nose out of trouble and no trouble will come to you.
Goodnight, sweet maiden of the golden ale!
Is it secret? Is it safe?
Hold out your hand Frodo. It's quite cool. What can you see? Can you see anything?
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days. The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.
Young Mr Frodo here, he's cracking!
There are few who can. The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.
Ah, I think I'll just have another ale.
Mrs Bracegirdle, how nice to see you. Welcome welcome. Are all these children yours?
Sackville-Bagginses! Quickly! Hide!
No. Well yes, b-b-b but thats not the point. The point is, Frodo, you'll be alright.
Nothing. There's nothing, Wait. There are markings, it's some form of Elvish. I can't read it.
From the ashes of fire shall be woken, A light from the shadow shall spring, Renewed shall be blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king.
