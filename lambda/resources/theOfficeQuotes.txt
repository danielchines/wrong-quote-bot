All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
So you’ve come to the master for guidance? Is this what you’re saying, grasshopper?
Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
If you think she’s cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. [growls]
Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There’s a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
It’s called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.
[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
My job is to speak to clients on the phone about… uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And… I’m boring myself just talking about this.
[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
Really? I didn’t… [looks at Pam] Did we get a fax this morning?
Why isn’t it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what’s the problem, Pam? Why didn’t I get it?
You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother’s, and… It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn’t work great with faxes.
OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can’t justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.
No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don’t panic. We haven’t made... We haven’t decided.
All the alarm bells are kind of going… ringie-dingie-ding!
I’ve spoken to Josh in Stamford. I’ve told him the same as you and it’s up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
Question. How long do we have to… [Telephone rings] Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?
I’ve been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?
Oh, my God! Oh! That’s… horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.
So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don’t want to worry people unnecessarily.
No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. [zips his lips] Like that.
So what does downsizing actually mean?
You guys better update your resumes just like I’m doing.
Are you going to Angela’s cat party on Sunday?
Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don’t see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.
I don’t think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might… I don’t think it’s many little girls’ dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um… Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they’re good.
Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
It’s overlapping. It’s all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
[crosses fingers] We’ll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn’t bother me.
Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.
Relax. Everything’s under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That’s important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. [Imitating Six-Million Dollar Man sound effect]
Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don’t you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.
If you’re unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. [Sighs]
I think I’m a role model here. I think I garner people’s respect. [Imitating a PA] Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.
Now I know there’s some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
I’m Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
I’m about to tell everybody. I’m just about to tell everybody.
Please, OK? Do you want me to tell ’em?
OK. You tell ’em. With my permission. Permission granted.
Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
I heard they might be closing this branch down. That’s just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don’t really know.
Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
It won’t be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.
Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I’m a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
You can’t say for sure whether it’ll be us or them, can you?
If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam’s favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he’s on to me. Um… [Laughs]
Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.
Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.
Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
Uh… yeah I got a ’78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It’s now worth three grand.
New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I’ve got some photos.
OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?
That’s real professional thanks. That’s the third time and it wasn’t funny the first two times either Jim.
It’s OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it’s so relaxed. I’m a volunteer Sheriff’s Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That’s sort of one of the rules.
No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?
It’s always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here’s the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight’s personal effects into Jell-O.
OK. Dwight, I’m sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
[Laughing] Nice. That’s the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
OK, that’s great. I guess what I’m most concerned with is damage to company property. That’s all.
Pudding. Pudding… I’m trying to think of another dessert to do.
Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
That’s why we’re all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
Roy’s my fiance. We’ve been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we’re gonna get married in the spring.
Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
OK. I’m gonna be a few minutes. So it’s only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we’re all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
Do I think I’ll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]
You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?
Just follow my lead. Don’t pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don’t want to…
Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?
50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you’ve made a profit… margin. You’re gonna run us out of business, Pam.
I can’t believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you’re firing me.
But the best thing about it is that we’re not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and… Just clean out your desk. I’m sorry.
Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with…
Oh no, I just decided not to. How’s your headache?
Dwight Schrute. My father’s name, also Dwight Schrute. My grandfather’s name, Dweide Schrude, Amish. That’s my family. I don’t know where they came, the Amish, came from originally. Uh, Amland.
Yeah, at one time or another every guy in the office has sprayed on Pam.
My name is Angela and um, I’m in charge of the accounting department. There are three of us, Kevin and Oscar.
It’s my job to keep the books in order. And, um, I… I’m, uh, immediately below my supervisor.
Oscar, how do I describe him. He’s like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I’m still the one that has to push it down.
There’s a lot of anxiety. I don’t want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house.
I don’t wanna be laid off. This is a good job for me. ‘Cause I need my nights free. I’m in a band.
Not very worried about downsizing right now. Because, uh, I think you’ve met Kevin and um…
Can I just say one thing? Um, my friend is Jewish, Art Geller. And a couple of years ago he, um, showed me how you can plant a tree in Israel, so I planted a tree. So… You know ’cause… Yeah we work in paper. Well, you know, I try to give back.
I have a lot of cat figurines on my desk. I think cats, really, are old souls. And, uh, Phyllis thinks so too.
What you don’t know… Well, it can hurt you, but if you don’t know it won’t hurt you. Then, you can just be happy for a little while at least.
Oh, John Belushi. What a crazy guy. Phew, freaked myself out this morning.
Oh, place around the corner. Nice. All right. See you later.
Understood, but it is what we need to capture what you’re saying as clearly as possible.
I think better to be a happy idiot then a, um… Then someone who knows the truth.
Gotcha. Good. I’d go with the rows. That’s a good idea.
Do you really have to do that right now?
Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
Mr. Decker, I’m sorry about that. What were you… Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That’s it. Perfect. So what I was saying… [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
I’m saving that ’cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
Did you have a good weekend going there?
Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. [to Mr. Brown] Oh, hey! This is Oscar—
Right. See? I don’t even know, first-name basis!
Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let’s do it. Oscar works in… here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?
It’s diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.
You know what? I’m actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great.
Come on people, let’s get ’em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!
You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don’t look at you as another race.
Uh, see this is what I’m talking about. We don’t have to pretend we’re color-blind.
That’s fighting ignorance with more ignorance.
Right. Exactly. Uh, instead, we need to celebrate our diversity.
Celebrate good times. Come on! Let’s celebrate diversity. Right?
Yes, exactly. Now here’s what we’re going to do. I’ve noticed that…
You know what? Here’s what we’re going to do. Why don’t we go around and everybody… everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
Actually, I’d prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?
Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.
Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I’m going to do is choose one and we’re going to act it out.
Hey, hey why don’t you run it by me and I’ll run it by him.
OK, can we steer away from gay people?
I’m sorry. It’s an orientation. It’s not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so…paradox.
Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.
How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I’m white and Chris is black?
So we’re going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.
I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.
Well, let’s have someone who wasn’t involved in the reenactment.
Kevin is a great guy. He’s a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.
Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
OK. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. He’s ruin… He’s butchering it. Could you just let me… [As Chris Rock] Every time… Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass… [Bleep] I take care of my kid!
Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
Excuse me, I’m sorry, but that’s not all it takes to be a hero.
Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?
A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look ’em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge.
[Clears throat] I don’t think I can sign this.
Michael, can I talk to you candidly?
We both know that I’m here because of the comments you made.
Here’s the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of… racial awareness and it’s probably more advanced than you’re used to. That’s probably throwing you off a little bit.
Um, it’s not throwing me. I need your signature.
Yes, but you’re not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.
Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn’t be embarrassed.
Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don’t.
Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It’s time. Let’s do some good.
Hey, we’re not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?
Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I’m going to add on to it later on.
Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um…
Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn’t make any sense.
Well, you know what, it’s kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let’s get this popping. Come on. Who’s going? Who’s going? Let’s go here. Oscar, right here. You’re on.
OK, Michael, um… Both my parents were born in Mexico.
And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
Wow. That is… That is a great story. That’s the American Dream right there, right?
Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?
Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There’s this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I’m not going to do it but it’s…
I admire your culture’s success in America.
Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
No, that was inadvertent. We didn’t actually plan that.
Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn’t help me.
Um… Shalom. I’d like to apply for a loan.
OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
Outback steakhouse. [Australian accent] I’m Australian, mate!
Pam, come on. “I like your food.” Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let’s do it. Let’s get ugly. Let’s get real.
OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver.
You’ll notice I didn’t have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. “Too soon for Arabs.” Maybe next year. Um… You know, the ball’s in their court.
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn’t mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
No way. I think she likes this stuff.
OK. All right. No. It’s good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
[trying not to cry] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it’s like to be a minority.
[Itialian accent] Maybe some spagh-etti.
Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn’t it? If I’d brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.
That doesn’t really make sense. Because you don’t call them collared people, that’s offensive. Hmmm… OK, well, it’s after five. So… Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.
Thanks for filling these out. I promise this will be quick. We only have about an hour.
Yeah. I would like to see us erase 100 years of racism in an hour.
Does this company have 100 years to erase?
Okay, um. Uh, I’ll try to make this quick.
I am a salesman, okay. And I don’t think we should be doing this during prime sales hours. If you can prove to me that diversity is going to help my sales, I’ll go elephant running with James Earl Jones. I really will, but not on spec.
HERO, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
I just think that HERO? It’s cute, but it’s… It’s empty, you know? It’s easy. Dwight, you know what, I came up with some terms of my own. Could you put these on the board? The first one is Inclusion, New Attitudes, Color-blind…
Oh, my sorry. That is not appropriate.
Well, it’s not ideal but you have to give me some credit ’cause I made it into a word.
Yeah, but it’s not appropriate. This is not helpful as a memory aid.
No, no, no, no, wait. Final one, final one this is important. The more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally.
It would’ve been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn’t have made any sense either.
Does anyone have anything else at all? Anyone besides Michael?
Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about…
Okay. I’m sorry, I’m sorry this guy’s a temp and I should’ve told you that.
No, no, no, no. An outsider’s perspective would probably be pretty helpful.
Yeah, but no, seriously. Uh, you know, he’s not a member of the full staff so, uh, Ryan you wanna just step outside?
I’m sorry, Michael. We’re actually out of time.
Yeah, um, there’s good things about Michael. He uh, uh… Yeah, definitely. Um…
Solitaire is a one-player game. It can’t have two players.
You’re not allowed to play two-player. You need to start over.
Are we going?  [Dwight puts four fingers in front of the camera to start a countdown] Don’t do that. Just say action when we’re ready.
Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action.
[mumbling] Should I… turn, no. Do it again.
Diversity Tomorrow, take five. Action.
Just let me do it! God! Three, two, one. Hi. I’m Michael Scott. I’m in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton… Keep the camera steady please! People are gonna get sea sick watching this. Ready? Three, two, one.
Don’t. Please don’t say anything. [sighs] Oh, God.
And action… Lights, camera, action. Whenever you’re ready.
Yeah, I marched on Washington back in the day. I went to the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, U.S. Mint, congressman talked to our class. It was pretty cool.
Talk like you’re talking to that race. I have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile. So keep it going. [camera shows Devon sitting outside with West Nile]
People treat us like the race on our forehead. And then we guess what race we are.
Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down]
How embarrassing is it? That’s not fair. Here…
Try this. [takes Dwight’s ‘Asian’ race and switches it with the one he wrote]
Good. [clears throat] So, am I a hunter gather culture?
Do I live near a harbor or an ocean?
No, I’m an inland. Am I a mountainous?
Okay, okay, okay, okay. I think I got this. Um, I am treated in a foreign way with a great deal of prejudice. Am I one of those tribes in Africa? The piggies, or whatever?
No. But I am, I am human, right? [Pam hesitates]
[Dwight’s new race is ‘Dwight’] I could be French.
[takes his ‘Dwight’ race off his forehead] Damn it, Jim! That’s not funny, Jim!
Oh, okay. Here we go, breakthrough radar. What happened? What happened here?
It didn’t have anything to do with race.
Okay, all right. Let’s keep on track. Keep on point. Let’s do it.
One time we had an ethnic festival in Scranton. One time.
Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
It’s good. This is good. We got it happening now. All right? Let’s keep it rolling. Let’s round it up.
Let’s go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.
Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the… [nods toward camera]
So, which health plan have you decided on?
I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
I think it was you who didn’t look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
The Gold Plan? I’m not even on that plan.
Well, I’d recommend it. It’s very good.
You know the whole reason that we’re doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um… It won’t be popular decision around the old orifice.
Well, it’s a suicide mission, you know.
Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
[scoffs] When have you ever done that?
Last night on Trading Spouses, there’s… have you seen it?
Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is…
There’s a decision that needs to be made, and I’m having an unbelievably a busy day. So I’m going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
Yeah. I just don’t think this is the kind of task, that I… am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I’d have to throw myself in front of a train.
OK, first, let’s go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
Ah, none. You’re picking a health care plan.
OK, we’ll table that for the time being. Two, I’ll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
[to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.
OK, I take it back, it’s a workspace.
Temporary workspace. You can use it.
What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don’t believe in coddling people.
In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, “Ow, I hurt my leg. I can’t run. A lion eats me and I’m dead.” Well, I’m not dead. I’m the lion. You’re dead.
There’s no dental, there’s no vision, there’s a $1,200 deductible.
[on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How’s tricks?
Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I’m busy, busy, busy. Can’t step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody’s doing. Everybody cool out there?
Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out ’cause the…
Pam! Whoa, whoa, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I’m getting a call.
I have to make a call after I finish… my work. You know what? Uh, just don’t let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I’m just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.
Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
If it’s the same thing, then why did you write “workspace”?
Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
You cut more than you had to, didn’t you?
Well, why did you do that? You work here, don’t you want good insurance?
Don’t need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
OK, well, if you’ve never been sick, then you don’t have any antibodies.
I don’t need them. Superior genes. I’m a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
He literally won’t come out of his office.
He’s got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?
Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Dwight’s health care memo. I told you about it.
It’s a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don’t you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?
OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there’s some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?
It’s ridiculous. Did you talk to him?
You let him walk all over you. It’s just pathetic.
Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn’t matter. The point is, they’re not unhappy anymore. They’re out there thinking, “Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He’s cool. I… what a great guy. I love him. I…
OK, you know what Dwight? We can’t write our diseases down for you because that’s confidential.
OK, well, I didn’t say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don’t write any disease down at all and it won’t be covered. Sound fair? Good. I’ll be in my office.
You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn’t find the knob.
I don’t know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?
Wait. What are you writing? Don’t write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? ‘Cause I’m suffering from both.
So, let’s say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?
I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That’s spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It’s not really a ride.
Its says here that it’s a 300ft drop.
It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.
Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what… you got laser tag or something?
OK, so I don’t know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?
All right, who did this? I’m not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
OK, whoa. ‘Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they’re fake?
Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I’ll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won’t receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] “Count Choculitis”
Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
What are you doing? Those are my keys.
Good luck. [closes door and locks it]
Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let… [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]
Yes I can. I’m manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
OK, can you hold on? I’m getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.
I’m doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
You don’t have anything you’re doing?
Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I’m not really doing anything.
Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?
Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
That’s not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
No. Please don’t use my cell phone ever again.
Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your… [dial tone]
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the…
Why don’t you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.
This isn’t the big surprise, is it? Because we’ve been having a pretty horrible day.
Uh, nope. Nope. This isn’t the surprise. It’s surprising, um… because you didn’t expect it. But you will… you’ll know it when you see it.
I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
I’m now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.
Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.
I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.
OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I’ll make sure that’s covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?
I don’t know, Kevin. This is important. I don’t want… [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.
Well, what? You could be referring to anything.
Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
Oh… Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
We all think you don’t have a surprise.
All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And… here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is… Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll… Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!
When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.
[clapping hands] God, yeah… Ah! This…
Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] “Hi. I’m Mork from Ork.” Well, I’m Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.
[heated discussion in the ‘Dwight Schrute Workspace’, door opens] I did not dismiss you.
Well, you have no right to ask those questions.
You came into my office voluntarily.
Because I don’t want my benefits slashed.
Well, maybe they won’t get slashed if you answer all my questions.
Sorry, too busy can’t even come to the door.
Yeah, no… [hurries to get up from chair]
Michael, Michael I… [blinds rustle] … inside.
You know what. I, um, I’m out the door. I’m going to a meeting. Pam, I’m headed out to another meeting. So see you later. Uh, here we go.
We stole Dwight’s trashcan and she found some of his early attempts at his sign.
Okay, here’s uh, this is very simple. “Dwight’s Workspace,” nice.
Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. “Schrute Space,” very medieval, very England. Um, this one’s forceful, this one’s very Dwight. “Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,” it’s good.
I really heard him on that. This one’s interesting I’m not really sure what he meant by this. Um, “Dwight Schrute Privates.” Tough to say.
Okay, you know what, Dwight. What if you got a really serious disease like Ebola.
Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?
Yeah. Well, have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable? ‘Cause that guy couldn’t get sick, just like me.
Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead.
Wrong. [walks away] Thank you Jim. Kevin. Stanley. [whispering] Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. You finished?
Well, it is time to call in a little favor. A buddy of mine runs this tourist attraction, actually it’s big. It’s probably one of the most popular in the state. So…
[on his cell phone] Hey, hey Craigers, my man! It is Michael Scott here. [silence] Dunder Mifflin, we supply your office paper.
Oh, I think we already did our order this month.
No, no, no, no. No, actually to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, here’s the deal. Um, trying to give the troops here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could bring them down to go on your big ride.
You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It’s not really a ride.
Well, it says here that it’s a 300ft drop.
Well, it goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.
Uh, okay. So um, once you get down into the mine, what do you do? Is it like, uh… Do you have laser tag down there or something?
No, you just look around. It’s a historically preserved coal mine.
Well, there’s the adjacent Anthracite Heritage Museum. They got some really interesting old mining tools. There’s also a photo mural exhibit. Uh, bat guano sculpture. [Michael hangs up cell phone]
Uh, he’s a small client. They don’t really buy much.
Why do you want health care, Pam? Hmm? Why do you want it?
Why don’t you just go ahead and use Roy’s health care plan, huh?
But you’re engaged. Aren’t you and maybe you’ve set a date for the wedding, hmm? And because you know you’re going to get married you don’t have to take our health care plan seriously.
We haven’t set a date. [Dwight laughs]
You wrote down… I didn’t give you permission to.. I didn’t…
Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.
You’re doing the right thing. Go ahead. What ‘s your confession?
Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. We’ll do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didn’t you?
Well, then why are you wasting everybody else’s time interrogating them?
Well, because I want to know who wrote those diseases down.
You want you to take this pen and this piece of paper and write this down. Write this down.
One second ’cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? ‘Cause, ’cause of the show, it’s one.
I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
I, but if there were, I’d be protected as assistant regional manager?
Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn’t guarantee it if there’s downsizing, okay?
But there’s no downsizing, so just don’t…
Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
It’s a real shame, ’cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.
I didn’t do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for… maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What’s the scuttlebutt?
Um… Actually, we don’t have any staff birthdays coming up.
Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!
Um… uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it’ll be a surprise.
Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
[grabs cell phone off desk] Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.
Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could… it’s stupid, forget it.
I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that’s dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.
No, yeah, I think that’s a good idea.
Well, there’s green, um, blue… yellow… red…
This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn’t like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn’t smack her.
These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing ’80s party last year. Off the hook!
So I was thinking, if you haven’t already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.
She’s not the only one that’s going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It’s not, uh, it’s not just about her, so…
Mint chocolate chip! That’d be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. ‘Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.
Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who’s vulnerable and who’s protected…
At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep]
And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says “No, Jim, here’s a way.”
There’s one other thing and this is important. Let’s keep this alliance totally a secret. Don’t tell anyone.
I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I’m not sure.
Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the… paper products?
Did you tell Pam about the alliance?
What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I’m using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
Right, that’s good, good, pursue this.
Well I’m trying to. Do you see what I’m doing?
But listen, I’m going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
They seem awfully chummy, don’t you think?
Yeah, what do you think that’s about?
Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
I could tell, from the body language.
Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone…
Toby and Kevin, they’re trying to get Angela kicked off.
Well, I don’t know, if Kevin’s in accounting, and Toby’s in Human Resources and they’re talking…
OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Because we’re strong, Dwight. Because we’re strong.
[staring at birthday card] Meredith, Meredith… Meri… Mary had a little lamb. Mary… Meredith had a little lamb. Don’t bring that lamb to work or it’ll poop on the floor.
Oh, not at all. Come on in. What’s going on?
My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you’d like to… you know… if…
Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
No, I’m always good… for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you… $25.
That’s… that’s… that’s very generous.
Oh, my gosh, well… Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into… morale. That’s what I say, so…
[whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?
Um, I don’t know, I’m just like, I’m going a little crazy ’cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?
Yeah, he’s making me take notes on these meetings and I’m, like, “These people are my friends.” But he’s all like, “This is confidential. You can’t tell anybody.” But I just feel like I want to… aaah. Just promise me you’re not gonna say anything.
No, will not, I’m not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
[looking at birthday card] Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.
Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
There’s not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
That’s where they remove the uterus.
Oh God! Dwight, no. I’m trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just… OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I’ll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.
OK, here’s the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith’s birthday.
I know, but it’s gonna be a little tough because there’s no good place to hide there.
No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
I’m a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are… at vision.
This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.
Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let’s go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.
Wait, this isn’t gonna work. The lid’s open.
I can’t do that. You won’t be able to breathe.
Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I’ll poke holes in the box.
So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don’t notice we’re both gone.
Can I trust Jim? I don’t know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don’t. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.
[singing] … birthday, dear Meredith Happy birthday to you…
You looked freaked, man. We said “Surprise.” You were, like, “What?” “What the hell’s goin’ on here?” Good cake. Why don’t you have some?
Oh, right. God, too bad. It’s so good.
You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I’d kill myself. ‘Cause this is way, way too good.
Pam, he’s in a box. He’s downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I’m serious. Go down there and work your magic.
Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.
Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar’s charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
Well, you know, money isn’t everything Jim. It’s not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you’ll give more than three dollars next time.
Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It’s gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So… God, I can’t even calculate what you’re gonna have to give.
I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know… 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn’t think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so…
It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, “However many dollars per mile.”
I just think it’s kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
No, no, no, no, no. That wasn’t what I wasn’t, that wasn’t… No. It-it-it’s not about the money. It’s just… it… it’s the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How’s your nephew? Is he in good shape?
Happy Birthday. [gives Meredith her card]
Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
“Happy Bird-day” Um… “Meredith, good news. You’re not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.”
[under his breath] I don’t know about that.
That was Stanley. “Meredith, happy birthday, you’re the best. Love, Pam.”
[pretends to vomit] Huh! Thanks, downer.
This is from Michael. “Meredith, let’s hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.”
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you’re gettin’ old.
Divorce. Um… OK, “Meredith is so old…”
Everybody? If… could do it? “Meredith is so old…”
“She’s so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.”
That wasn’t even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don’t get mad at me.
This isn’t my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers?  I think we could have done better than that.
When I retire, I… don’t want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.
A check for the kids, and for the team.
Come here. [hugs Oscar and In a low voice] Don’t cash that till Friday, OK?
OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and… [Pam starts laughing]… spy on our other branch. No no no.
But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut… and put peroxide in his hair…
[yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
God, I don’t even, I don’t even know how to explain this. Uh, um… Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um… um… we were… we’ve just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um…
It’s stupid. It’s, it’s just office pranks.
[looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?
Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That’s the game. Convince him we’re in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.
[With blonde hair] That’s politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
Good, excellent, and file sharing off and done. Security software, 128-bit encryption, firewalls. Get up, I’ll install it on your computer.
Pssh, stupid. Identity theft happens all the time. I can become you like that. [snaps fingers] But no one can become me.
Not true. And if they did, they couldn’t because I’m password protected.
[telephone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold please.
All righty then, well I see you’re going for the whole bored supermodel thing. “Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. May I help you?” [takes a drag from an imaginary cigarette] Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.
Yes, I am, absolutely. So, the next call we get I’d like you to smile. I’d like to see a big smile.
I know, somebody will. And we’ll wait.
Sometimes there’s a lot of time between the calls.
We will wait for the call and you will smile.  Let me try something, just while we’re waiting.
Tell me if I’m smiling or not. [covers face with hands] Hi Pam, how are you? Was I smiling?
Okay, let me try this one. [covers face with hands] Hi Pam, how are you?
I wasn’t smiling that time and they can tell too.
Thank you. All right, when we get a call I’ll come back and you’ll do the smile.
[smiling] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. One moment I’ll transfer you.
[throwing away a banana, mayonnaise, and a sandwich from the refrigerator, smells the mayonnaise] God. [drinks from the milk carton and puts it back] Mmm.
[looks in  the refrigerator] Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn’t in the refrigerator. You wouldn’t know anything about that would you?
Any employee may dispose a food item…
…that risks contaminating the other food item. Read the official kitchen regulations memo.
Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it’s not an official memo.
Uh, uh, not my problem. Okay, this is a paper factory not a bacteria factory.
Dwight, it’s not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing? [Dwight is tapping each of the bobble heads on his desk and making them bobble]
Uh, if they don’t bobble, what’s the point?
My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic.
Okay, but I don’t want to be put on a mailing list.
We need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Because we’re strong, Dwight. Because we’re strong. God, it’s freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.
Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke. [Dwight pretends to smoke]
Do a poem for Meredith’s birthday or uh, limerick. Limerick. Um, [knock on  door] there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Come on in. Who had a big, smifflin.
Hi, do you mind if I sign the card real quick?
No, not at all come on in. [Toby signing the birthday card] No, no. You can’t. No, red hair is my area. We have it on tape, so…
That’s my white out. Get your own white out. Just… what’s the matter with you? God. [Toby leaves] Okay, um, there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Who had a big, puttifflin. [thinking out loud] Mifflin, spifflin.
Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.
Uh, yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
There’s not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
That’s where they remove the uterus.
Oh God! Dwight, no. I’m trying to write something funny here, okay. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
[sighs] Come up with a joke that I can use, okay?
Okay. Hey Meredith, where’s your uterus?
No, not a uterus joke Dwight. Please. Something useable. A joke.
If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity? [cut to Jim holding his hands up like a champion]
Meredith. Oh, oh man, ah gosh. I can’t remember why I came over here. Ha, ha.
Oscar, uh for future reference just think you should know, that you should probably make it clear that your nephew is doing the walkathon and that he doesn’t actually have cerebral palsy. Okay.
No, no. I know you didn’t intend to, but I just I got the idea and I, uh, I just don’t it has a lot of ethical merit to make people think something. You know? And then prey on their emotions.
No, hey  it’s just kinda uncool, okay? I, just… Play fair, you know, play fair.
“Meredith, let’s hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.”
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you’re gettin’ old.
Divorce. Um… Okay, “Meredith is so old…”
“She’s so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.”
[clears throat] What’s the difference between Meredith and Michael Jackson? Michael Jackson’s surgery was unnecessary.
You’re talking about my hysterectomy.
Yes! Thank you. God. She gets it. [laughs] We just picked the best one right? Just had it.
[whispering] I’m so sorry. [Angela, Phyllis, and Pam all whispering] … seriously, we’re just…
Um, no, no. Come on. No. Don’t comfort… don’t comfort her, that’s not… She doesn’t need comforting. We’re just joking around. I think she’s… No that’s very unprofessional. I think she’s being very unprofessional over there.
I’m only going to ask you this once. Are you part of an alliance?
Pam, Pam, thank you ma’am. Messages, please. Thank you.
Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
No. And that’s not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
[to camera] When I let him come to my pick-up game…
And that’s why you have an assistant regional manager.
Yes it is. Assistant to  the regional manager.
So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be…Jim.
God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I’ve ever seen go to someone’s head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
My fiance has plans for us this Saturday.  So I really hope that Dwight doesn’t make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I’m kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.
All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don’t you call it that, I’ve earned the right.
And here we have “Mister Roger’s Neighborhood.” Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He’s temping upstairs.
And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
No, it’s Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.
Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
[laughs] And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it’s part of the job!  Rapport!
[on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty’s expired, but isn’t it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn’t defective? OK, fine, three years.
Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set… and that was three years ago.
So, um, one o’clock sharp and we’ve got a game on.
Oh, I see, you’re chickening out on me. You’re bailing on me.
No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that’s the busy time.
Oh, well, I’m glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I’m down here it doesn’t seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can’t take it. OK, fine, have it your way. [clucking and dancing like a chicken]
All right, fine, you know what? One o’clock.
I… yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
Nerd. That is why you’re not on the team.
Uh, [in a nerdy voice] “I’ll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword.”
OK, so, let’s put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.
Uh, I don’t know. I don’t remember saying that.
Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um… other starters… Me, of course. I heard it that time.
I’d like to play if it’s just for fun. I played basketball in school.
[ignores Phyllis)] Um… Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
But, I’m getting paid to skip lunch?
Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?
I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.
Michael, look. [Dwight throws paper at the garbage can]
Close. All right, uh… Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.
No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.
OK, we’ll see who’s working this weekend then.
Jim, you’re in charge of the vacation schedule now.
[hits Pam in the head with a piece of paper] Off the backboard!
Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
I don’t think so Michael. Besides, I can’t cheer against my fiance.
I’ll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and…
Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
Oh, yuck, that’s worse than you playing. … ‘Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That’s where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you’re on the team! All right, cool! Very good.
Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?
Oh ho, oh, he’s running. He’s running. He’s running, but he can’t hide because you know what? One o’clock, you better bring your ‘A’ game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!
Why don’t we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley’s.
Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I’m gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.
No, that’s not as much fun. You know what?
OK. Cool, you’re on. [to Dwight] Don’t screw this up.
[to camera] Classic beginner’s mistake, eating before a game.
Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I’m the safety officer, not you.
Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I’m, yeah, I’m looking forward to playing. You know, I think I’m gonna impress a few people in here.
Yeah, I’m just forwarding the phones.
[laughing] I’m just saying, Roy is very competitive.
And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so…
Well, I’m going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I’m also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
Um, I think I’m gonna be up at the lake.
I think I’ll see you at the mall. Yeah.
All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?
OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy.
Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got… Um…OK, all right, you guys.
[taking off his shirt] OK, we’ll be skins!
Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don’t you do the uh, jump ball OK?
Don’t listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you’re sleeping in the car.
Stanley!  What? You gotta be kidding me! !?! [Roy steals the ball, and goes for a lay up] Oh… Here we go! [Lonny shoots and makes it] Who’s on him? Somebody get him!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here. [Jim saves the ball from going out of bounds and passes to Michael] Here we go. Three! [Shoots and misses] Let’s go to the zone! We’re going to zone!
De-fense! [clap, clap] [Michael joins in] De-fense! [clap clap]
Who’s got Roy? [Jim does a behind the back move around Roy for the basket]
[misses a half court shot] Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually hit those. [Dwight scores] Dwight, I was open. All right, let’s go.
[Roy bumps Michael to get around him] OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That’s a foul.
OK, I’ll take it. [misses free throw] OK.
When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It’s gone, I’m in the zone.
[misses another shot] What is wrong with me today?!
Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don’t know… I might just be a basketball machine. What’s Dunder Mifflin? I’ve never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um… well, that’s probably gonna happen, actually.
Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut! [Michael looks away and misses Jim’s pass] Whoa!
[scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[dancing] Where you at? Where you at? You over there? I’m over there.
That is cool. Is that like the Robot?
[Ryan scores] Nice! Come here! [gives Ryan a chest bump]
Can we just do one? That’s cool, that’s fine.
You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
[scores] Yeah! [points to Madge] In your face!
Football is like rock and roll, it’s just bam-bam-boo… And basketball is like jazz, you know? You’re kind of… Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It’s all downbeat, it’s in the pocket, it’s like… [singing] Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah…
[singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter…
[steals the ball, scores, mimics singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball.
All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on!
What’s going on? What’s going on? You’re playing like a bunch of girls.
All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on.
Shoot, shoot it.  [Roy hits Jim in the mouth with his elbow] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression!  Oh, that is… You all right Jim? Suck it up.
[Jim makes a shot after pushing off Roy] Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?
[Jim pushes Roy to the ground and makes another shot] Yes!
[Darryl scores] Watch the long passes, you guys!
[Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight.
[Phyllis scores] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, what’s the score?
[Jim has the ball] Jim! Jim! Right here! [runs into the elbow of the guy guarding him] Ow! God! Hold it!
What’s your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?
No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.
[mocking voice] Yes, it was. You know what, I’m just being fair.
Oh, really? No, I just put my arm up…
Game over. Game over. That is it! I’m sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that’s just… we’re having a friendly game. It’s a shame. This is a damn shame, but we’re like a family here and that just, that won’t fly.
Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes]
Wait, what does that mean? What is it, a tie? What’s going on?
Well, let’s just say whoever was ahead won.
It was us? Really? I didn’t, I didn’t know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.
No, no, no, I’m not coming in on Saturday.
Um… well, you guys, you know, I’m the boss so…
So what’s that? We’re coming in on Monday, right?
[to Pam] …so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
[to Jim] Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend.
Yeah, he’s, uh, pretty good, huh? [to Roy] Let’s get you into a tub.
The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don’t win. But we did because we were ahead.
[slams palms on desk] Pam, Pam, thank you ma’am. Messages, please. Thank you.
Uh, they look that good? Wow. [Mike Myers voice] Oh, Pam please behave. Mike Myers, genius. Um, no actually I got them at a fancier place. Target.
Michael, could I talk to you for a second, please?
In your office? [in Michael’s office] You know that is why you have an assistant regional manager.
Yes, yes. Assistant to  the regional manager.
Like trying to find the camera, to give the camera a look. Okay, we’re done. Is that your stomach? I keep hearing somebody’s stomach. [whispers] God.
So, you uh, see the Sixers game last night?
[howls like a wolf] Oww whoo whoo! The Answer was on fire!
Iverson. Yeah, always man. It’s very important.
Oh, man! Man I tell ya. Iverson has maybe got me beat by like 20 pounds, 3 inches. [makes ‘pop’ noise with his mouth]
No, neither am I. We both look good.
Please, have a seat. [Kevin sits down] Okay, why not?
I tell you what. You give me a tape of your band and a tape of the Steve Miller Band and I’ll get back to you. That is all.
Pac-man [imitating the noises of the video game Pac-man eating dots]
[on the phone] Is this Michael Scott? My secret lover. My intercom, I told you never to call me here. Never! [Michael’s laughing]
I’m not your lover! I’m am not Michael Scott, I am Dr. Bergerstein. Your proctologist.
It’s not a Jewish joke, so don’t worry.
[on the phone] I want my money back you greedy Hebrew. Bergerstein!
[clears throat] No, hey, hey , hey. You know what I just wanted to remind you about the game today. One ‘o clock. Big game, big game.
[sounds sick on the phone] I can’t make it.
Mmm. No, you said you could man. We’re counting on ya. You know you’re playing point guard.
No. Hey… I mean, although it’s just for fun, you know we want… I was counting on you man.
[eating Tootsie Rolls from Angela’s candy on her desk] Mmm. Good. Mmm.
They’re one per person. [points to sign “Please take one!!]
Would you like to have a vacation this year? That’s what I thought. [continues eating Tootsie Rolls] Mmm, delicious.
Well, I though we were saving money for the wedding, but apparently Roy thought it was more important to buy two WaveRunners. I don’t really ever get to use the other WaveRunner that’s supposed to be mine because his brother uses it and they race.
Jim, you’re the new schedule guy, huh?
Yeah, I hear that. You know what? This little baby might come in handy.
Forget it. It’s just a dry erase board.
Oh, no it’s not. Okay, check it out.
Okay, that’s insanely complicated and the first thing I’m going to do is erase it.
No, you’re not because I spent hours on it.
Okay, I will. Okay, fine. You’ll be back.
[Dwight holds the first aid kit up] I’m the safety officer, not you.
Isn’t that crazy? I’m a Volunteer Sheriff’s Deputy. Lackawanna County says that it’s okay for me to perform CPR, but for Michael my lips aren’t qualified enough for his perfect little face. It’s nuts.
[wearing a face guard] I’ve almost had my nose broken a dozen times.
[back to the basketball game] Let’s go Lonny.
[Michael steals the ball] Yeah, Michael. Go Michael. [makes shot]
Birdie. He’s not the guy with the cheeks. Kenny G. Is… if you knew jazz, you’d know who I mean. Kenny G. God. Glad I remembered that. Jazz people know who he is.
[back to the basketball game] Dwight, pass it to Jim! Pass it to Ryan!
I just want you know, you’ve been a big disappointment to me today, okay.
I’m in. I’m in. Here we go. [Lonny gets around Michael to score and he ends up in front of Phyllis] Zone, Phyllis! We’re playing zone!
[Michael hits a half court shot] Ah! [clapping]
You just said, let me uh… check my notes.  You just said…
Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.
Hey, hey how is Alan?  Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!
We’ve created an incentive program to increase sales.
At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That’s cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?
Um, question: Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that’ve been promoted to…
No, Michael. No. You can’t win this prize.
Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.
It’s illegal. Can’t do that.  Next best thing.
Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That’s just stupid.
There’s a person here who wants to sell handbags.
No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction.
Pam. Pam. Come on, I’m busy. So just tell her to go away.
[exhales loudly, looks out window and sees Katy] Oooh, alright I’ll talk to her.
All right girls break it up, you’re being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.
Don’t say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?
Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you’re like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0.
Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I’m  against violence in the workplace.
So uh, you know what? I usually don’t allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It’s yours. All day.
There’s an HR meeting in there at 11:30.
Well, lets put ’em in the hallway. Give ’em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.
This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I’m right on the other side of this wall. [knocks on wall]  used to be a window here. There’s not anymore. So, that’s where I will be.
So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don’t hesitate to ask. I’m right here.
I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the ‘bucks.
It’s like a slang for Starbucks. They’re all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don’t have the good stuff here.
Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.
So are you jealous ’cause there’s another girl around?
That’s a very rude thing to say, Kevin.
So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?
The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.
[handing Katy a mug of coffee] There ya go. Nice steaming cup o’joe.
I have an idea.  Why don’t I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?
Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um…
Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?
I’m installing File Share on all the computers.
Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?
You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we’re all millionaires. I’m probably closest. So here’s Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy.
Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.
I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he’d never heard that before he worked here?
It’s nice having Katy around. It’s another person for Michael to um, interact with.
Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby.
Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O’Hara?
Toby’s divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?
You and your wife, and you have kids.
Oh that so – that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?
I should probably get back to my table.
I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike.
Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh?
[glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.
[Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn’t dating Pam.
Pam and I are good buddies.  I’m sort of Pam’s go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh… Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
Hmmm… she’s been talking to Michael a lot.
So, what? You’re Assistant Regional Manager.
Well, you know what Dwight? He’s your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You’re both um, salesmen. I mean that’s something right there.
True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know?  They don’t know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.
Alright. Here’s the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
I don’t want a purse. Purses are for girls.
Dwight, that’s not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.
Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
Okay, I’m just going to use the bathroom, and then I’m going…
No. You don’t need the bathroom. You’ve got it. Go.
Okay, shhhh stop… stop whatever you’re doing because this is going to be good.
[mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name’s Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
[mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.
Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh… This is the prettiest one of all.
I’m going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?
[gives Dwight a thumbs-up – mouths the word] Good.
This one’s really good for a hot date.
Congratulations.  You need a hot date more than anyone.
Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right?  [to Katy] So how’s that uh, coffee from earlier?
Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing.  So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?
Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something.  I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.
Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
Oh, I know what you’re thinking. You’re not prying this out of my hands, but don’t tempt me because I’ll give it to you!
[Katy reading text message on her phone] Oh the rotating um, steam wand. [Katy looks annoyed] What? What’s the matter?
Oh, nothing.  My ride just bailed on me.
Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
No. I really don’t want to inconvenience you.
God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I’m out of here at five sharp.
I can go earlier. ‘Cause I’m the boss. You know, whatever. I’m out of here slaves.
Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.
Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good.  Five o’clock sharp.  I will give you and your purses a ride home.
Great. Cool. Cool. [takes deep breath – looks at camera] Yeah, okay.
I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
No it’s not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I’m onto—
Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it’s against the rules and everything. Because…
No, no, no it’s not against the rules.  She’s not a permanent employee so it’s not.
Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
Well, might be a ride home.  Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot…
Please. Please, I am your inferior and I’m asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
You cannot promise me, or you won’t promise me?
[laughs] Dwight, no. I don’t know. It’s too early to tell. I don’t know how I feel. [Dwight sadly looks away]
I think you’ve made a really good choice, she’s really going to like that.
You’re welcome. Thank you.  Hmmm-hmm-hmm.
Is that from the machine that was in your office?
I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.
Okay. Like he’s going to win anyway, right? [laughs]
Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin’. Just checkin’, double checkin’, checkin’ on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and…
Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
That’s sad. Or it’s innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]
Huh? huh?  Come on… Come on, Pammy I was just kidding.
I was just kidding.  You know I didn’t mean it. I can’t…
Jim is a great guy. He’s like a brother to me.  We’re like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?
I don’t like to necessarily touch things. I’m just… I’m shopping.
Oh no, it’s fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It’s really uh, kind of festive. It’s got a lot of personality.
Hey, how’s it going?  Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?
Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.
Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?
Would you like to help me with a special project?
[in Michael’s car] Okay, just throw out all the empties.
Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin.
Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water]
What about this bottle of power drink?
Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.
I do. That’s what I’m best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let’s talk about purses.
Katy but you know what, don’t try to sell me one. Okay, seriously ’cause I’m just here to learn.
Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can…
What, stop! Whoa! That’s my Drakkar Noir.
No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I’m not paying for the label. Right here. Give it.
Not it’s not, there’s some in the straw. [Michael opens bottle and wipes straw along his neck] There, now you may throw it out.
Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat?
No, I’m kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?
Ah, well I think I’m gonna see Katy.
Oh, man I don’t know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.
I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we’re gonna help Roy’s cousin move.
That is cool. Well, I’ll see you Monday though, right?
Sure you don’t want me to help you with that?  Cause I can grab that no problem.
Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you.
See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim.
I don’t know. Grab a drink, I think?
I uh, I probably should have told you, I don’t need a ride now ’cause Jim can take me home after so you’re off the hook.
Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
I got this. [taking Katy’s bag from Michael]
Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it’s lighter.
Alright now, I’m gonna warn you. Don’t freak out, okay?
This is a really nice car. In case you haven’t noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
This is really well made. Good stitching. Excellent fabric. [shakes the purse from side to side by it’s handle] You sell a lot of these?
Snakes are waterproof. So, I’m betting that it’s waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?
‘Cause I could look it up real easily.
My belt’s made out of alligator. Check it out. [lifts shirt]
Dwight. Dwight. Dwight! Okay, that’s it. Keep it in your pants.
Well, don’t do that. Where are your glasses?
He wears glasses. Did you know that?
Well, now suddenly he can see. [laughs] Okay, take off. See ya. Bye-bye. [gives coffee to Katy] There you go steaming hot cup of joe.
Oh, I know your hero. Yeah, saving you from Animal Planet Jack over there. [laughs]
Thank you, Al Gore… for the Internet. Can send messages from one side the global to the other in the blink of an eye. Can you believe we couldn’t do that ten years ago?
Right, but 20 years ago we couldn’t and that is amazing. Here’s Toby from Human Resources. This is Katy. Toby, Katy.
Well, they’re good snacks. They’re good food, good meals, good lunch. Roman noodles are good too. You still sleepin’ in the car?
‘Cause he slept in the car a couple times.
Are you still taking the antidepressants? ‘Cause it was a good idea. ‘Cause it’ll help. It’ll help, man.
Okay. I’ll see you in a bit. [whispering] She’s pretty cute isn’t she? See you in a bit.
Um, I like that one I think. [Ryan hands her a purse]
Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably.
You know Michael’s been talking to her too.
Well, Pam I’m not gonna lie to you, he’s chances are none. Um, he’s 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is “Mambo #5.” So…
I don’t know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.
Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.
You know what, just in case she’s looking you should put some stuff in it.
Anything. [Dwight begins to fill his new purse] Good. Yup.
Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot.
Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great. [Dwight throws the purse over his right shoulder and gets back to work]
‘Cause I’m in a Steve Miller Tribute… Tribute Band.
All right. That’s looking good. Hey um, Ryan do you have any music I can borrow.
Ah, I know, everything really. I love it all. I love music.
Okay, do you  like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?
Yes, I love both of those so much. A lot of ’em.
Uh huh. Yup. That last thing they did was great.
Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.
Cool, so maybe hook me up  with some Fleebulls and some Hive.
Hi, here you can have this. [Dwight gives Kelly his purse] It’s a mini-briefcase, but you can use it as a purse.
You know what they say about a car wreck, where it’s so awful you can’t look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.
[in a Fat Albert voice] Hey hey hey! It’s Fat Halpert.
[in Fat Albert voice] Fat Halpert. [in normal voice] Jim Halpert.
So why don’t I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don’t you show of your Dundies to the camera?
Oh, I can’t because I keep them hidden. I don’t want to look at them and get cocky.
Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it’s just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say “Don’t go there” but that’s… lame.
And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren’t you Stan? Why don’t you, ah, show them some of your bling.
I don’t know where they are, I think I threw them out.
Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?
Yes we should. I… you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, [turns to Kevin] someone had eaten all of them.
[in video] To Oscar Martinez it’s the “Show Me the Money” award! Yeah!
[in video] That’s supposed to be confidential.
[in video] He has the award-ah! …it’s a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!
[singing along to tune on video] A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing…
[in video]…a little bit of Phyllis everywhere…
Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It’s great.
[on video] …a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers… …a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of…
[quietly laughing] It wasn’t. I swear.
So, what’s the joke? You’re not perfect either.
[laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies’ room wall.
That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you’ll be punished less.
[talking to the speakerphone] Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?
[on speaker phone] It’s a, it’s, it’s a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
Well, you could take the bus.  You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home.
Wuh… Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So…
No, we don’t approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so… we’re not paying for this.
Yeah, I’m here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
You’re dropping an A-Bomb on me here.
Really? I’m dropping an atomic bomb on you?
You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party…
…it happens once every billion years.
And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.
Okay, well, I don’t understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn’t even make sense.
Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
What were you doing in the ladies room?!
…no, no, no, no, it’s not what you think.
Why were you peering over the stalls?!
[in video] The Dundie award for “Longest Engagement” goes to Pam Beesley.
Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That’s what I have to say. Ah, Roy’s accepting.
[on video] Thank you Roy. Are there any words you’d like to say, on Pam’s behalf?
[on video] Ah, w-we’ll see you next year.
[on video] Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!
I’m not changing that, it’s the best one.
No, it’s hilarious, you’re right. I just think, um, “world’s longest engagement”, um, we’re all expecting it, you know?
That’s why it’s funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don’t get married, it gets funnier.
Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
Oh, [taking it to heart] lazy. Uh huh.
We are going to have two men’s rooms.
Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to…
…Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.
Okay, well, that’s just ridiculous, so just don’t, I-I don’t have time for this right now.
Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions…
Yeah, not bad, right? So let’s make this the best Dundies ever.
Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.
Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I’m not afraid to use it. [points] Devon!
“The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I’m psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you.  You’re just a name and number and no one even says hello.” [to Ryan] Card!
The Dundies are kind of like a kid’s birthday party, and you go, and there’s really nothing for you to do there. But the kid’s having a really good time, so you’re, kind of there. That’s-that’s kind of what it’s like.
“You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-“
[to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab.
Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we’re going to be doing separate checks.
You said, we could bring our families.
Well, I’m looking forward to meeting Terri.
It’s this person who’s hand I’m holding Michael.
[to Dwight, in a low voice] Shut it. [normal voice] Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight.
Really? We don’t have any girls from HR.
No, that…for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.
And I was about to take her bra off…
…when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-
[clears throat] Alright, so let’s get this party staaaarrrrted.
Um, guys, where you going? Pam, show’s just getting started.
And now… to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts…
…the “Busiest Beaver” award goes to Phyllis Lapin.
Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual.
Well, we’ll fix it up. You don’t have to display that.
…because that’s what happens every time!
…talking about? He’s a jackass every year.
[Put’s his hand on Pam’s arm] Come on, we’re going to Poor Richard’s.
[Breaks Roy’s grip] No, I don’t want to go, I don’t want to.
If you would have asked me that, then you would know.
[in a stereotypical oriental accent] Herro everybodeeee. I’m gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould.
Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
I’ll just get a ride home from Angela.
[doing impression] Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny.
Right? You know wat I’m talking ’bout.
[to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim’s beer] Can I get a drink?
This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.
Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The “Hottest in the Office” award goes to… …Ryan the temp!
Yeah. [singing to music] “Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you.” Here you go.
What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don’t know what I’m going to do. That’s the least of my…concerns right now.
And the “Tight Ass” award goes to Angela.  Not only because she is everybody’s favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose.  So…come on down.
[Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.
No, no. ‘Cause the ice melts and then it’s like second drink! [laughs]
The “Spicy Curry” award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor!  Get on up here. Here you go.
Um, not everything means something, it’s just a joke.
I know. It’s ju- they didn’t have any more businessmen. So…
[Michael is singing to the tune of “Tiny Dancer” by Elton John] “You have won a tiny Dundie.”
Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?
Uh, you know what guys, we’re just having a little office party, so if you want, uh…
[Something flies by Michael] Hey, you know, cool it guys, really-
Let’s cut it. [Dwight turns the music off]
Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
[starts clapping] Yeah, alright Kev.
Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
[clapping] Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies!
[getting his spirit back] Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, we’ll keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.
Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech [other people start joining in]
Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don’t…
So, I don’t know what to think about this award. But at least I didn’t get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling]
And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley…
…I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.
It is the “Whitest Sneakers” award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!
Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen! [Pam grabs the microphone from him] Oh, here we go.
I have so many people to thank for this award.
Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.
And, I feel God in this Chili’s tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!
Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman. [Pam hugs Michael and gives him a quick peck on the cheek] Oh! Thank you.
Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It’s okay, I’m a sheriff’s deputy.
Don’t get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
It’s okay, I’m going to use my shirt.
I’m sorry, you’re gonna have to put your clothes back on, people are trying to eat.
Was this year’s Dundies a success? Well, let’s see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost.
I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!
We have a strict policy here not to over serve.  Apparently, this young woman was sneaking drinks off other people’s tables. I Xeroxed her driver’s license and she is not welcome to this restaurant chain ever again.
Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn’t a concussion.
Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work.
I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let’s get you home, you’re drunk.
Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
Yes, that’s true. I have never won a Dundie. I am more than okay  with that.
I think I’m gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby. Toby is so cute, except he has that stupid kid.
Yes, I’m the designated driver, which is very important. We need everyone to get home safely. [sighs] But no one ever gives me gas money, and people live all over. It’s expensive.
[scoffs] Like a gaggle of geese… [jibbering mockingly]
All right, we need something for Kevin.
What do we know about him? He’s an accountant.
He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He’s a bowler.
[talking over Jim] He’s fat. The fat accountant award.
Well, you seem to have this under control.
I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies’ room wall.
Really? What did they say? “For a good time, call Michael Scott”?
Uh, no, no. No, I think something bad, maybe.
Why do you think that? You just immediately go to that, Dwight? Why are you so negative? Why…
I mean, you just come in and you’re just negative…
Do you want me to find out what it says?
What does that even mean? What are you… What are you talking about?
Just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me. But don’t tell anybody that I have anything to do with it because if they ask me, I will say that you are crazy.
Thank you. You won’t regret this, Michael.
What award would you like to give Dwight?
Angela, it’s simple. Just tell me what the bathroom wall says.
I don’t talk about what goes on in the restroom.
I’m not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what’s written about Michael.
I don’t says those kinds of things out loud. It’s inappropriate.
Okay, I’ll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?
I think his characters are pretty funny. Especially Ping.
Well, what should I do, guys? Seriously, do you want me to just cancel the Dundies?
No, we were just hoping you wouldn’t do those characters, like last time.
Ping? Everybody loves Ping. He’s my most popular character.
I think many people find that character slightly racist.
Really? Well, he is based on the Chinese delivery guy that I have, who talks exactly like that, so, I think you should take it up with him instead of me.
Look, I’m just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.
[sighs] Well, neither of you are Chinese, so what… Why do you care?
Phyllis, no, no. Do not listen to her. She’s out of her mind.
Dwight was in the ladies’ room and he was looking at me.
He was looking at me in the ladies’ room.
That’s totally unfair. I was just in the ladies’ room in order to spy.
That’s what I said. He was spying in the ladies’ room.
What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, “Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.” I’m not even attracted to you.
Write him up or I’ll take it to Jan.
Okay, all right, I will do that. I will get to that definitely. Absolutely.
All right, let’s wrap it up. Come on, we’re late. The Dundies are starting very soon. Accounting, let’s go, let’s go. Okay, I gave you fair warning. [turns off their computers] Out. Who’s next, customer service? Meredith, let’s roll.
Here we go. [organizing his costumes] And that. [to waitress] Hey. How you doing?
[singing] You down with the Dundies?
[singing] You down with the Dundies?
[singing] You down with the Dundies? You’re all my homies
[singing] You down with the Dundies?
I have listened to that song so many times and I still don’t know what OPP stands for. Other people’s… Something. I… [shakes head]
So, Pam, I wonder who’s gonna get “longest engagement” this year.
Well. You’re not goona get longest engagement, man, ’cause we got that locked up.
I wonder what I’ll get. I brought my fiance.
All right, our next award… ah, yes, this award goes to the most creative writing on the ladies’ room wall, and the winner is… Who is it? Who wants to claim it? Shiny Dundie. Who wrote it? Great idea, Dwight.
I’m just saying I don’t think it’s appropriate for you to have given Ryan that award.
He’s hot, all right? What do you want me to do about it?
Okay, that is fine to feel, but not to act on.
Well, okay, I based it on what I felt was unanimous office sentiment, and this isn’t even about what Ryan thinks. It’s about you. It’s about how you feel about the Dundies. Admit it.
‘Cause Ryan asked me to talk to you.
Okay, I don’t have time for this. I need to get on stage and you are breaking my concentration. [imitating Native chant] Me Chief Michael Scott. Here to trade…
Excuse me, Goldschlager, extra flakes.
We don’t have that. You want a Presidente Margarita? Blue Pacific Margarita, El Nino…
Just a chocolate shake, chocolate sprinkles.
Okay. No, no, no, no, no. Lie still, lie still.
Jim, not now! We need to cushion her head. Lie still. Please, Pam. Do not move.
You have to put your clothes back on. People are trying to eat.
Put your clothes back on. Get, get right now.
I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested.
I will. I will. You need to calm down.
You and your party really need to leave right now.
Absolutely. Is this mine or is this Chili’s?
You know what? Don’t worry about it.
Keep it. My gift. [hugs Chili’s Manager] Thank you. Have a good night. See you next year.
Um… ‘Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.’
I am king of forwards. It’s how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We’re like ‘Friends’. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer.
So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background]
That’s funny! That’s funny. Not offensive. Uh… because it’s nature. Educational.
Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
Yeah… maybe. Maybe. Well, we’ll see. Because I… I don’t know if it’s… [muffled by jacket over his head] Whup! Come on! Hey!
What has two thumbs and likes to bone your Mom? [points at self] This guy!
Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.
Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade ‘A’ gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.
Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You don’t know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So here’s the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent.
Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It’s going to be a bumpy one!
Well, to be fair… blondes, brunettes, you know, there’s a lot of dumb people out there.
Oh! Wow! I didn’t say it! I didn’t say it!
I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch.
Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.
Hey, um… what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!
Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?
Oh. Bad boy. [to Ryan] Um… Ryan? [makes Donald Duck noise]
Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
Why does everyone ask me that? Who the hell is that?
I’m really excited to meet your Mom.
My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn’t have a cell phone… which is cool cause it’s kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she’ll walk in.
I’ve decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. I’m going to forward it like it’s hot.
Forward it like it’s hot. Forward it like it’s hot. “Old School”.
Um… I need to talk to you in your office. It’ll just take two seconds.
Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he’s really not a part of our family. Also he’s divorced so he’s really not a part of his family.
The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
It’s really not a big deal, Michael.
It is a big deal. It’s a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!
And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer…
What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That’s why it’s a joke.
Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you’re all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away.
Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I’ll go over that later.
I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can’t wait to see how you handle it.
A guy goes to a five dollar… lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says “Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?” This is what’s at stake.
Um, yeah, no, well… I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.
Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where’d you get em? Like Queers R Us?
Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know… a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the… good thing you don’t have a lot of business to start with.
Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
So you don’t have the biggest package. Don’t feel bad.
[fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.
Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.
[kissing noises, sheep baaing sounds]
So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that’s it. Pam?
Um… I just wanted to say that… Just, my Mom’s coming in today.
Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
She’s coming in today and maybe just don’t joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Um… in fact, basic rule of thumb, let’s just act everyday like Pam’s Mom’s coming in. All right. That’s it. Um… if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.
I know, I know. It’s good. It is not over. It is not over til it’s over.
Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn’t because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we’re losing? Seriously?
Exactly! Mmwwah [blows kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you’ll have bad luck.
That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls’ school. I am taking it down right now.
Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let’s just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.
All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
She would have definitely slept with me.
What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her “partner” in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line?
What if they made out? In front of everybody?
At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
Okay. Well, then let’s act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be… Okay! We’ll use the doll. Pam. Pam?
[Crossing the Line: Rules for the Modern Workplace]
That’s what she sai [clears throat]  Nope, but… Okay. Well, suit yourself.
You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?
Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um… I’m just sad the public school system failed him so badly.
Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
In today’s fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let’s take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves ‘where is the line?’
Hey, settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead?
Oh, Mi… ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That’s that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is…
Yes! [to video screen]  Right here. You are a naughty girl!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa… Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
[to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.
Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we’re watching that Corporate gave us… Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.
Don’t ever let this little bitch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour.
I don’t have any DUI’s so I can drive myself, but thanks.
Where is Michael Snot? Sniffing some dude’s thong? Probably.
So you are the lawyer, Mr. O’Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.
Well, it’s probably because you don’t get ’em.
When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don’t come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn’t arrest a guy who’s just delivering drugs from one guy to another.
You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What’s the problem?
The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can’t say anything.
Well, that… that’s true in a way. You can’t say anything.
Where’s the line? Where’s the line, Jan.
Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
No, I didn’t. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll]
Does that include ‘That’s What She Said’?
Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so…
Mwah! [kisses hand and salutes office]
You would have done the same. You just didn’t think of it first.
Mike… Michael. Please. I… I… really.
Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O’Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
[to camera] And motorcycle head injuries, worker’s comp, and diet pill lawsuits.
[to Albiny] ‘Scuse me, I’m sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O’Malley is your lawyer.
Mr. O’Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can’t be too careful about what you say. Mo’ money, mo’ problems.
Okay. Well, let’s get you out of here, James. Um… I think we’re under an hour still, so…
Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here.
I know. We’ll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
I love my Mom. Okay. That’s probably really the most obvious statement ever.
Yeah. I’m in charge of this whole area.
So a guy goes home, tells his wife, “Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery.” She goes, “Oh my god! That’s incredible! Where are we going?” He goes, “I don’t know where you’re going, just be out of here by five!” [men laugh] Boom!
This is where I used to keep my computer.
Yeah, yeah, but I uh… I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So…
So this is like, um, an organization station…
Oh, thank you! So! We ready for dinner?
Well, you know… actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it’s okay, because I am very used to killing time.
Okay, I’m going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?
There’s this guy. He’s at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched ’cause all these women are smokin’ hot perfect 10’s, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh… [points at Phyllis]
No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.
Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
We’re in the same High School class.
Well, I have a late birthday and usually September’s a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There’s a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
Oh my. They really got to you, didn’t they?
You don’t have to worry. I’m not going to…
You know what? The only thing I’m worried about… is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.
You just… You look good. Your shirt looks… You look real good.
Well, you said I looked thin, so what does… Does that mean I’m like thin weird or thin handsome or… [laughing]
Yes, well, of course. Of course. [laughing]
Wait, Jim, no! Don’t drink directly from the can. Okay, I’m serious. It’s all over the Internet. They use the same shipping company as a rat poison, and it gets on the can. [Jim takes a drink] Well, you’re an idiot.
What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.
[Email chiming] [snickers] Did you see that?
She wouldn’t do that. She’s a Senator.
Office romance. For example, Pam and I are dating, do we have to disclose that?
No, but I’m saying hypothetically if we were dating…
Well, Roy is dead, and I ask you out.
And now Roy and Pam are dead, and we have your stupid rules to blame, Toby.
I know we’re having that harassment thing this afternoon.
Sometimes when we IM, I send you that little winking face with the lipstick.
Yeah. I realize that might be harassment.
Yes, it is harassment and I’m going to be suing the winking face. I’ve hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.
I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don’t you take a couple hours. The office is yours. “Home Alone,” “Risky Business.” Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.
I’m just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
Ok. [Removes biscuit, leaving only sausage, egg and cheese.] Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.
Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.
Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they’d throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.
And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People’d obey the law, there’d be less troublemakers.
[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk]
Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it’s up to me to revive him.
Sometimes when he’s not here, I try to throw stuff in it.
No way. Let’s do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.
Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
I’m good. I can make sure things are up to code.
Please, I’m always the guy you rely on at work.
Well, this isn’t about work. This is closing on a condo, it’s completely personal.
Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that’s the way they talk in movies.
We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don’t you have everybody work on their expense reports and I’d like them in by the end of the day.
We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?
Yeah, I changed them to your new address.
Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription.
How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?
NO, well can you get on that, because I don’t just read Cracked.  Thank you.
What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
I don’t know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?
[tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down.
What? No, Dwight. It’s fifty degrees outside.  Don’t… please…
I… Just… Would you put it up? [roof opens] Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
Check it out. [points at sunglasses] Terminator.
I do not understand what you spend your money on.
Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
Yeah. It’s a terrible system, I know.
[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael’s out.
Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.
[flicks football onto Kevin’s desk] OH!
Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.
Because of how much Angela hates it.
Hey, do you guys have any other games?
Sometimes we play “Who can put the most M&M’s in their mouth?”
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back… wait… [turns around] no, it’s this one, right here. Home, sweet home.
[bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that’s what this sound is all day.
Michael, this is Bill. He’s the head of the condo association.
Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He’d always get rolled over by something.
This is smaller than your old place.
Yeah, small. I’m buying it and I’m not renting it. So, it’s still an upgrade. He doesn’t know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.
Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It’s a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.
Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.
It’s very safe. It’s very clean. Also, it’s very accepting of all lifestyles.
It’s a very gay-friendly neighborhood.
Oh. Good. That’s good. It’s good to be accommodating of that.
Let’s go check out the master bedroom.
Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
Yeah, I got a game. It’s called “work hard so my kids can go to college.”
No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.
Warrantees don’t cover it, plus they’re a rip-off.
So that’s the problem, is solved. What?
Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
[sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle …andle …andle. Which I found in the men’s bathroom …room …room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
Now the bronze are really blue, and they’re also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.
I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
Let the games begin. [sings Olympic theme]
And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow.
Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total.
Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total.
Wow, you’ll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
Forget about retiring when you’re 65. Hey, I’ve got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that’s where the nurse can live.
Um. Oh. [moves stove burner] Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?
Um. I’m going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.
A thirty year mortgage at Michael’s age essentially means that he’s buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn’t hear the other dead people.
Uh. [breathes deeply, head at knees]
You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I’m blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton.
In English, box of paper snowshoe racing.
The thing about Jim, is when he’s excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.
So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.
The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don’t… I don’t…
…know if you showed me this same unit or not.
Michael, this is the unit you saw and…
Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
As far as I can tell, I’m the best-looking person here.
There’s a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It’s just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you’ve no place to go but down.
Is this a financial thing? If it’s a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom.
I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.
You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now.
I made the right decision. I’m glad I signed. I’m a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We’re having fun.
Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs]
Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It’s Phyllis!
Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
[empties bowl of M&M’s into his mouth]
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
There’s something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you’ve really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.
I’m thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we’ll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you’re, you know, you’re gone.
Question. Where can I put my terrarium?
It’s a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.
Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
Are you sure you don’t want to play?
Come on Angela, don’t you have a game?
I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
Very nicely done. I think that’s H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I’m sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I’m … Ok.
Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It’s a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it’s under the porch.
Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?
Ryan Howard. Ryan! [claps] Gold medal.
I made something for our closing ceremonies.
What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!
[sees Angela making check mark on tally sheet]
A little bit more and I would have had it.
You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early.
Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.
Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don’t you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I’d love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.
Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15.
Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys?
Nothing. Guys? Timer’s still going? Er?
[hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.
Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
Okay, today. 5 o’clock. Closing Ceremonies.
Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What’s going… What’s going on?
Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It’s very cool. It’s a three bedroom, gay-friendly.
Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You’re on the top one.  [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps]
I don’t really know what to say. Um, I’m not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment.
And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.
Yep, not as good as gold. [national anthem plays] Why are you playing the national anthem?
Oh. [doves move across cord] What the hell is that?
Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It’s important, so…
I found Dwight’s wallet in the parking lot.
I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don’t know what to do. What do you think?
Okay. Put everything back exactly how you found it.
Hey, Dwight. Jim and I found your wallet in the parking lot.
Dwight, I swear, we didn’t do anything.
Nice try. [on the phone] Cancel card. Cancel card. Cancel… card.
I mean, you’ve got, you’ve got stuff here. You rented “Mermaids.” You can’t… It’s a movie. You can’t deduct that, you know that.
Next year, you should file your stuff in a basket.
Remember last year he slipped by with “Stripes.” He rented “Stripes,” he had it for a week.
And that got through, so maybe he’s thinking he can do that from now on.
Oh, okay. I’ll tell you. Let’s see here. Three bedroom, two bath…
…contemporary townhouse. Two car parking…
[talking over Michael] God, what a steal.
…all fixtures included. Yes, this is… This is looking good.
I think it has a… Yeah, it has a deck. They call it a porch, but it has a deck.
That is good. That’s it. That’s what it is.
Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.
Home owner. About to join an exclusive club, Dwight. Maybe some day these people out here will know what that feels like. Maybe not. Who knows? Not my problem. [groans]
This is all mine. All the way down around the corner. It’s a shared space, but I can use it whenever I want to,
Okay, so I called in a favor to my buddy at the police department.
Um, these are the crime statistics for the surrounding square mile over the past four years.
one noise complaint, several speeding tickets.
Hello! How are you? I’m, uh, just about to close on 126 over there and I guess we’re going to be neighbors. Very cool, very cool. So, uh, so what’s the vibe? What’s the vibe of this place?
Uh, I don’t know. It’s pretty quiet.
Because I loves to party and I’m gonna be partying my butt out at this place.
Okay, but there’s an 11:00 noise curfew.
Hi, I am Dwight Schrute, Mr. Scott’s associate.
Him. I have got a couple of questions about the neighborhood. Have you had any problems with prostitution, crack dealing, gang violence, etcetera?
Here’s a question for you. I have a convertible. Is it safe that park that in my driveway. [Man steps back inside his house and shuts the front door] All right. See you soon. Good guy. Um, cool.
Okay, you get a one-second hold on the ball…
…and you bounce it off the wall on your side of the tape.
Oh, okay. Oh, do… that’s what the tape is for. I didn’t know.
Yeah, Michael asked about it once. I just pretended not to hear him. He left.
Oh, boy. This whole condo’s shifting. It’s like this place was built on ancient Indian burial ground.
Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office?
Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.
What? [toilet flushing] What are you doing in there?
Fill it full of cotton or soundproof insulation.
Seal it off with drywall so you don’t hear Yo-Yo Ma over there all the time.
You know what I might do, I might make this into a kids’ room.
Kids? You don’t even have a girlfriend.
I will have a girlfriend once she sees this place. I’m gonna get married and I’m gonna have kids.
Well, that depends on how old she is. What if your girlfriend is 55?
I’m not gonna date a 55-year-old woman.
Living on a farm, your sense of smell gets very sharp. For example, there are beets in the condo two doors down that way. And someone over there, I believe, is a big fan of olives.
I’m gonna back out of the deal. Nothing personal, but I feel like I have been taken advantage of here.
This smells of fraud to me. This whole thing just kind of stinks.
[looking into his coffee mug] What the hell?
So we’re still on for lunch? You’re meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
[to Jim] Hey! You can just give her your extension.
Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he’s kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.
The temp agency wants to know what you think.
Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! [laughs]
Michael’s in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn’t evaluated me in years.
Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?
Ah, well, I’m interested in business.
Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?
Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
Ryan’s about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I’m like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.
[speaks in a Yoda voice] Much advice you seek. [regular voice] Do you know who that is?
There are ten rules of business that you need to learn.  Number one:
And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.
[to Ryan] [makes clicking noises like shooting a gun] Hey!
Michael and I have a very special connection. He’s like Batman, I’m like Robin. He’s like the Lone Ranger, and I’m like Tonto. And it’s not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.
[in background, on phone] But it says no late fee… .
This is not a test! Move to the exits!
[in phone] No, I don’t hear it? Alright.
Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!
This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!
STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?
We’ve got smoke! We’ve got smoke! Smoke! Gah! [Spots Kelly] Oh, Kelly! You’re okay! I’ve got you!
Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They’ll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let’s go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!
Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.
Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That’s rule number two.
Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael’s number one. Where is he? Where is he?
Okay, well, let’s… . let’s kind of take it a little slower.
Hey, Michael. Um… Ryan needs his number for the count off.
Okay, he can have 14. Marjory’s not here today.
Well, he needs a permanent number, right?
Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.
Um, yeah.  Okay. That… No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges.
That’s funny, too. But if we’re the Three Musketeers…
I don’t want to be like “a guy” here. You know? Like, Stanley is the “crossword puzzle guy”. And Angela has cats. I don’t want to have a thing… here. You know, I don’t want to be the “something guy”.
Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
[to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there’s a…
Okay, so… three books on a desert island? Angela.
That’s one book. You’ve got two others.
I would take The DaVinci Code… so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
Okay. Great, that’s going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question:
Then I would bring an axe, no books.
Rule number four. In business, image is everything – Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I’m seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it?
Okay. Thought people read more books.
DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith?
Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County…
Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just… .
Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The… the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you’re going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
…and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene…
Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop!  So… oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. ‘M’ is for Murder, ‘P’ is for…
That’s a test prep for business school.
Um, oh, thinking about business school?
I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
So you think you know a lot about business?
I… wouldn’t even know where to start.
All right, um… Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
[to Dwight] Shut, it. Can I… can I just do it please? [to Ryan] Uh, it’s equal.
It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn’t need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
Self taught. You didn’t even go to college.
You know what, Dwight? You don’t need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know… Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then… then you’d know what you’re talking about.
[scoffs] Come on. I’m studying with the master, huh?
For instance, why don’t you go to business…
[to Ryan] You should learn from him, right?
Stop. Dwight. You know what? You’re acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He’s not your five year old brother, Dwight. He’s a valued member of this company… and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.
I did not go to business school. You know who else didn’t go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So… so it’s not the same thing. At all.
Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?
It’s a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
You are so smart. You are so eff-in’ smart. You should be teaching me.
Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused…
Breakfast Club. Um… The Princess Bride and…
Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
All right. Let’s move on. Let’s move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
Um… okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I’ll… I’ll finish explaining the rules. Let’s… let me explain it first, and then…
[“Everybody Hurts” by R.E.M.] Think you’ve had too much / in this life.
Yeah, so we’ll get right… You know what? I’ll be right back. Stanley, you’re taking over for me, buddy. I’ll be right back.
Yeah, it’s all him and Michael talk about anymore.
You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself ‘I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends’.
He doesn’t even know that I do that.
Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That’s going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.
I’m sorry I said that, I didn’t… just part of me meant it. Besides, he’d end up being a hero anyway.
You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
Oh Jim, I’m not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.
Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.
What’s up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit?
The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes.
Come on people, you know the rules of the game now.
Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?
Oh, I play this at home all the time while I’m falling asleep. What, uh… . Where are we? Where are we here?  Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?
Uh… Oh, I got it! Uh, what’s the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond?
Aaaall right. Who’s next, who’s next, who’s next, who’s? Jim? You’re next. Who would you do?
Um… Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He’s really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan. ‘Cause he is going to own his own business.
Who’s, uh… Who’s next? Who we got? Whooo…
[answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk…  this is great timing.
Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So…
If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
Dwight, don’t! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.
What if he dies in the fire?  And that’s the last thing you ever said to him.
I didn’t say it to him. I said it about him.
[in the background] How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don’t know either.
[on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We’re just here, we’re playing Desert Island. It’s when you pick your five favorite DVDs…
Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It’ll make it easier for him to find.
You got to… you got to give it to me again.
Uh, I better tell somebody. [to fireman] Excuse me, sir…
Dwight!? Great goin’. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What… Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.
[coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don’t teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don’t teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.
Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?
Hey! I know what’ll impress everybody, I’ll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.
[singing] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning—
[singing] …since the world was turning.
[sing gibberish to “We Didn’t Start the Fire”]
[singing] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning…
Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over and I have my answers.
Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go.
I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just… good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car.
Okay, I think the game’s over… People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
[looking at Roy and Pam] They are soo cute.
Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?
[sings] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!
Okay. Rule five – safety first,  i.e. don’t burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer.
Oh… look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.
I’ll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.
Seventy and clear, that’s nice. Where’s that?
I’m Michael’s number two. He’s one, I’m two. He’s Alpha, I’m Beta. He’s A, I’m B. It’s easy. Whatever Michael is, I’m one less.
Rule three: Reach for the stars. And if you fail, see rule four. Rule four:
Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And at the end I will reveal, that they were all just one rule.
Plus you can go, “Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.”
No, I’m not trying to trick him. I’m trying to be a good mentor. So…
No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan.
I’m not asking the temp for an extension unless I really need it.
I know Michael’s every move. It’s not something you can just pick up. I could write a book about him. Literally. I started once, but Michael made me stop.
Oh, nothing much. What’s up with you?
Good. Good, I’m good, too. How’s it cracking?
You know what you would love? Guns N’ Roses. When I was your age, I loved Guns N’ Roses. Do you like Guns N’ Roses? I’ll make you a tape.
Someday, temp. I’ve got a couple of shirts that don’t fit so well anymore. I’ll bring them by. Okay, see you later.
Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don’t want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.
Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. [snickering] Sixty-nine. Seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three.
I like fire drills. You know what’s the greatest? Like, when you were in school and the teacher would let you have class outside.
Yeah, it was great because it was like you’re supposed to be working, but nothing ever gets done.
Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.
Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn’t be stuck here at a paper company.
Yes, there is a real fire, but it’s okay. Everyone got out fine. This is why you practice these things.
Yes, yes, I ran out first. A captain is always the first one on the ship and the last one off the ship. And this parking lot is our ship when the building is on fire. So, I ran out onto the ship.
Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.
Say Anything, The Shining, Annie Hall, that’s too obvious.
Those are like my favorite movies. I didn’t really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.
Toy Story 2, one of the best movies I ever saw. I went for my daughter and stayed because you can’t leave your daughter in a theater.
Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.
Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, [snickering] Weekend at Bernie’s, Weekend at Bernie’s II, and, oh, Groundhog Day.
I have a client who watches that movie once a week, at least.
I should put you in touch with him. Maybe we could get together and work on that account.
Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?
And then you go to school for three years.
For two years, and it’s only at night, and then it’s on your resume forever.
Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?
I know why she’s calling. It’s the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.  And somehow I’m supposed to put on a costume and smile. [dials a number on his speaker phone] Okay.
Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.
Oh, she’s in a meeting. Uh, she just wanted the name of the employee you let go.
Well, I’m gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it’s best to wait till the end of the day.
I just need the name of who you’re planning to let go.
I don’t know… yet. I will have to call her back.
If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?
Jan wants the name as soon as possible, Michael.
I’ll call her back. [talks softy, to himself] Wish I could fire Sherri.
I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It’s… these are people’s lives you’re talking about.
[notices Michael’s costume] Papier-mache?
Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.
Why did you put it off until Halloween?
I think it’s gonna put a damper on the party a little.
You’re worried about the party? There’s a man’s life at stake here.
No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance… and who you think deserved to be fired – who would that be?
And… sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
You’re costume is fantastic! [laughs]
I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. [bobs his head around, causing the costume head to jiggle around]
Oh no, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t. [Michael laughs] Aah! [laughs, then leaves] Okay…
Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.
[eyeing Jim’s costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
I’m a three hole punch version of Jim. ‘Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
Yeah, well look… [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me?
I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
[looks to Oscar] Oh, boy… look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.
All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?
You know, I don’t know. We put them all up last night.
Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I’ll approve the overages. Sound good?
Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I’m  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I’m going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
But we don’t keep two sets of books.
Well, that’s not what I’m saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.
Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.
Oh, like … the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
[laughs] Yeah. That would be perfect.
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don’t really play soccer or anything.
Well, I don’t really have two heads. So…
Wait, what are you again? Oh, right… Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing]
Okay, okay. Um, how ’bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]
Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department…
… doing the work that could be done by two.
This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.
Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.
It’s not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
[turns to the fake head, listening] What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
You’re right, I didn’t even think of him.
Yeah, that’s actually a really good idea.
That is not a very nice thing to say about him.
I’m just trying to figure out why you’re sabotaging things.
I’m guessing Angela’s the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
[on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim’s attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.
Stanley, could you come with me, please.
Look! I’ve got some bad news. You’re fired. You need to pack up your things and go. [Stanley laughs.] I’m serious, Stanley. It’s over.  I’m sorry.
[laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You’re fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
So. How did it go with Stanley? How… how’d he take it?
If you want to fire him, you’re going to have to tell him yourself.
I don’t wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I’m certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just… [waves Dwight away]
Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just…
Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who’s getting a better job offer. Like, for real.
Don’t take this the wrong way, but… you should go for that job.
Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it’s definitely a step up. And a challenge.
Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe… maybe I will. [starts walking away]
This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael’s office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
What?! That would’ve solved all my problems.
… so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
If you left, I wouldn’t have to fire anybody.
Big deal. Oh, it would’ve worked out so well. Can you get it back?
I can’t. I… I suppose I coul… no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.
[clearing his throat and interrupting Jim’s talking head] Can I speak to you a minute?
I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.
I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.
No, no, no. That’s just the first thing… came… in head.
Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I’m really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it’s purely budgetary. It’s not personal…
I’m going to kill myself, and it’s your fault!
Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they’re saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you…
I’m improvising, so just try to keep up. [phone rings]
Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.
[picks up the phone] Michael Scott here.
I’m gonna kill you. I’m going to kill you for firing me.
Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth…
Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off.[sits back down in his chair and waves Jim off.] Just, just… yeah.
Oh. That was like crazy. ‘Cause I was…
You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you’d wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.
I… we’re gonna have to… You… you want something better.
No, I don’t. I wanna stay right here.
Why… why are you making this so hard?
Um, I think there’s a misunderstanding, Michael.
No, of course  you can’t go. We haven’t even started this horrible process of… okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you’re a great guy, and I like you, you’re… you’re, goodbye.
Let’s call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.
What old days? What are you talking about?
I can’t change anything. This is the way…
Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?
Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He’s terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.
Okay, well… I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you’re always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.
No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You’re they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you’d see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You’re a fine man.
Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one’s gonna miss him. Good, good, good.
Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?
No, no, no, no, no, no! You had it right the first time.
Exactly. You gotta go with your gut, man.
Huh. No! I can’t, no. I can’t go back. I would look like an idiot.
So you might not look like an idiot?
No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and…
I just hope that you and I can remain friends.
Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili’s. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.
[takes the gift certificate and tears it up] Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp. If any of you wanna meet me for a drink, I’m going to be at Poor Richard’s. And the rest of you can go to hell!
[watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party?
Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I’m sorry… for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.
[motions for her to follow him] Come on.
[ringing the doorbell of Michael’s Condo] Trick or treat!
He… Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.
You look great! And you’re a princess?
You’re a lion. [trying to to open a bag of candy] Wow, I want to hear your, your… Oh! [the bag tears open, spilling all the candy] Oh, okay, that’s all yours. That’s all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.
Hey, you. Big Jim. And Phyllis. Working hard, Phyllis?
Of course. You’re always working hard.
Keep it up. And there’s Stanley. No costume? Well, no, not trying to fit in. I wish I had your confidence, I really do.
No, no. What could possibly be wrong? Everything’s great. Just keep living your lives. Everything’s gonna be fine. [sighing] You are all such wonderful, innocent people.
Michael, do you have the name of the employee you’re letting go? I’d like to start working on out-placement.
Fine. If you are so anxious to see a head roll, it’s you. There. You brought it on yourself. Too bad. Can’t say that I’m sorry. It’s a relief.
I don’t report to you, Michael. I report to the head of HR in New York.
You asked for a name, I gave you a name. Now you’re not doing your job. Why don’t you just resign?
They would just send someone else. You need to have an HR representative.
Just know that if I could have fired you, I would have.
I’m going to have to do this Sopranos-style. Just whack him. Guys, could you take the freight elevator, please?
Hey, you wanna see a really messy show? Follow us around. Come to our office.
I will handle it in the best way possible, but in case he or she goes postal, you will be available to subdue. Am I correct?
I don’t know. Hey, are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building?
Oh, shoot. Okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.
All right. All right, this is it. By the time I get back to our floor, I will have decided. [elevator bell dings] Wow, that’s  a fast elevator.
I have a proposal, everybody. Listen up. Now, Corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts, but I refuse to fire anyone. So, I was thinking that maybe all of you would take a 10% pay cut and that would save the money. Yeah?
Yeah, We’re not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision.
Okay, great. Fine. Well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame. Stanley. Not the guy who was trying to be creative. [turns around to find Toby standing behind him]
[slurping] Oh, wow. How long have you worked here? How many years, Creed?
Yeah, that’s right. Fifteen years and three months. Wow, you were hired before I was. Must be thinking about retirement.
It’s just that you never got married and you live in an apartment.
Yeah. Yeah. And I buy them stuff, you know. Oh, made some bad investments. Why are you asking me this?
Well, you never asked me about my life before, is all.
Of course, I did. I always… Yes, I do.
Do you have something specific you wanted to talk to me about?
You have no clue why I’ve asked you in here?
Oh, here we go. This… um, here’s the deal.
The human being man’s name was Devon.
Devon. The… Oh, is this the man that you…
Is that what you’re… Okay. Oh, you sound a little… A little upset.
Uh, well, I am. A little. Justifiably. My Halloween is ruined.
Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know… I know how hard that was.
Do you? I don’t think you do. Devon was one of my best buddies. And now he hates me.
Thanks. Thanks so much. You think it was good?
[talking over Jan] Think I did a good job? Great. I feel good. I’m gonna give myself a pat on the back.
There. I’m doing it. Right there. Great.
You know, guys, Michael has really incredible decision-making abilities. Michael’s really incredible at making decisions.
[camera pans over, Michael is sitting in a chair] Yeah, blah, blah, blah.
Pussy. Here, pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. Meow.
You people are revolting. By far, the least popular people here. I should have fired you. Who knew Devon was so popular and had so many friends. So well-loved.
This is not funny.  This is totally unprofessional.
Ok, well, you’re the one who lost the desk.
Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
I think you should retrace your steps.
Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!
Colder… warmer… little warmer… there you go, ooh, warmer… warmer… warmer… warmer… warmer … cold, cold, cold, back up… ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
[In bathroom, answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
[On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
Jim, I’ve given you this information, like, twenty times.
…now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%.
Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
[On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second…
[Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it’s Sempai…
You know what, let me give you a call right back. I’m going to uh, find it and then I’ll call you back, thanks.
Yes, I just had a ques-… Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
Assistant to the Sensei, that’s pretty cool.
I don’t want to stay until seven again this year.
I don’t really have any control over that Stanley.
[singing and tapping on his coffee mug] I don’t want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.
Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
Uhh, yes, I did, here’s the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.
Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael’s office]
[to Pam] Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.
Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.
Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.
Last year they were out of order, weren’t they Pam?
Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.
Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That’s pretty good. Um, actually, I’m sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.
Catch-22. Yes. Why don’t you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what’s your cell?
What’s her address? [Ryan’s cell phone rings]
[in his office on his cell phone, talking in a fake high voice] Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
[Reading Jim’s palm] You’re major and minor lines cross at a ridge – that sucks.
You making this up as you go along, aren’t you?
Well, at least I don’t have cavities.
Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan’s phone rings]
[looks to see who is calling but doesn’t pick up]
[Taps on the glass in his office to get Ryan’s attention] Pick up.
[in a high pitched voice] This is Mike Tyson.
Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
Impossible. The way they’re programmed… You’re mocking me.
Look, I’m going to offer you a little piece of advice. I’m not afraid to make an example out of you.
Oh, that’s not advice. What advice sounds like is this:
Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
And this is more a ying-yang thing. The ‘Michael’ all cursive, the ‘Scott’ all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.
No women or children, unless provoked.
Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?
Yeah, yeah, I don’t think that would happen.
Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I’m just lucky I got out.
Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is ‘Becker’ now.
And after that, nobody ever messed with the ‘Damn Rascals’ ever again.
Sounds tough. When you’re a Jet, [starts snapping] you’re a Jet all the way, right?
Have you signed the expense reports yet?
Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t’s and dot some i’s. Alright, I’m going to be in my office if anybody needs me. [Puts Dwight in a headlock] Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That’s my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.
Oh, queer… [realizes he is on camera] eye. Queer eye. That’s a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.
Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.
You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented ‘Armageddon’…
… he cried at the end of it. He did.
Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year’s Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?
Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I’ve been hired to protect? No, I did not.
Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
Yeah. [Jim opens office door for Michael] Thank you.
Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
[to Kevin, who he is teaching to fight] Take this pen and stab me with it.
No, it’s not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I’m probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?
Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can’t stop you from being mugged. He’s just not tough enough.
He’s a purple belt. That’s really high.
Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That’s ridiculous. I could murder him.
Wow, that’s actually pretty cool Dwight.
Now watch, let me take you from behind.
Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.
In case you remember, I was defending my honor… like a samurai.
Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.
Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches:
No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
You know what? You’re just lucky that we are at work right now.
Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwight’s dojo?
No, it’s free during the day. It’s fine.
I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.
I think it is. A guy told me about that.
Actually, it’s a symbol for eternal discipline.
[Reading Pam’s palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting.
Your love line- I’m just kidding. I can’t see anything.
[Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok.
[Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up.
What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
Hey, put me down. Put me down. [Meredith turns and looks at Jim and Pam] Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey…
Ok, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach, or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins. Alright?
Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn’t have any rules. Maybe one – no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.
Alright, that’s the way you want it.
I’m comin’ atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.
Dwight, you have… No, you have something… God, you look like such an idiot! [Lots of yelling and flailing of arms by Michael and Dwight]
Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.
You can’t see. You can’t see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. [Michael is using his head guard to hit Dwight] Eight points. Nine points. [Begins to hock a loogie]
Seven new messages. First New Message. [Michael’s voice] “Hi, Ryan. This is Saddam Hussein.” Next new message. “Hi, Ryan. This is your girlfriend… and I’m mad!”
My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?
[knock at the door] Yeah… uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?
I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
Just put “The Hospital.” Contact number:
He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.
Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam’s desk] Have a good weekend.
Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I’ll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?
Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably.
If you’re doing anything crazy, give me a shout.
Yeah, alright, I’ll um, see you Monday.
This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
Well, [points at himself] busier. Making the time.
Michael, can’t your conversation wait till Monday.
Well, you don’t even have anyone to go home to, Toby.
The shipping place closes in a half hour.
I know, but I’ve been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it’d might help me out. What do you say? Let’s gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.
I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?
And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.
I know, I know, I know, I wouldn’t be offering it if I didn’t think you could handle it.
I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
No, no. Three month probationary period. Let’s not tell anybody about this right now.
Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
[Dwight grunts] Great. Excellent. [Dwight yells] All right. That’s okay.
[Dwight’s pager goes off] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second.
Dwight, you can’t use your pager in here, I told you.
Do I feel bad that I haven’t bonded with the other students? No, I’m not there to make friends. I’m there to attack people.
What about Oscar? Could you beat Oscar?
I don’t know.  He looks pretty scrappy.
Unless he has a shiv, in which case it wouldn’t be a fair fight.
No women or children. Unless provoked.
Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael?
Yeah, I don’t think that would happen. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I’m just lucky I got out. I was a bad ass mo-fo. Stanley knows what I’m talking about.
I’ve never lost a fight. You know why? My motto. Never say die.
Forget it. Is that chocolate-vanilla swirl?
Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl.
Don’t look at me. [smiles at camera]
I don’t know why I write my name on things.
I’m still recovering from last night. But maybe.
You’re gonna have to take them off. It’s a sign of respect.
Oh. Well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect. Stinkyfeetville. Kind of a ying-yang. [exclaiming] Oh, stretchin’. I like to stay tight. Compact. [Dwight screaming]
Here’s your gear. Please put this on.
Do you have, do you have anything in, like, black?
Okay. Gentlemen. [to Michael] You ready? [to both Michael and Dwight] Okay, listen up.
[to camera] That’s Alyssa. My senpai. She just qualified for regionals.
Alyssa? I guess she’s technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let’s see how she does.
God, you look like such an idiot. [both yelling] [grunting]
Did you hear about the fight? Well, it wasn’t much of a fight, actually.
No. Are those purchase orders signed?
I opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.
Hey, Stanley. I don’t tell you how to do your job, do I? He…
Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don’t get these purchase orders…
Grow a pair, Stanley. Right? There not gonna downsize because I miss a lot of deadlines. That’s not how business works, okay? [sighs] Okay.
[door opening] All right. Here you go, Princess. Just finished with part one.
Well, what about the other stuff that has to be in today?
If you didn’t badger me with so many questions, Pam, I could be done with it by now.
Michael and his jeans.  He gets in them, and I’m not exactly sure what happens.  But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans.  I know that’s why he started casual Fridays.
[to Ryan] I’ll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk]
This is a projection of the county’s needs…
Wow, graphs and charts, somebody’s really been doing their homework.  Looks like USA Today.
Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals…
So this possible client they’re talking about, actually a big deal.  It’s Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years.
So when we get to the Radisson, I’d like to, um-
Radisson just gives out this vibe, “Oh, I’m doing business at the Radisson”.  It’s kind of snooty.  So.
You had no right to do that, Michael.
Here’s the thing. Chili’s is the new golf course.  It’s where business happens.  Small Businessman Magazine.
It will.  I sent it in.  Letter to the editor.
Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting.
Uh huh, uh huh. [under his breath] Power trip.
She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.
Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.
Oh my God, I win!  Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.
Wait, not Roy.  Say it’s not your fiance. [laughs]
I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.
Ok, let’s do this thing.  [to Pam] Wish us luck.
[under his breath] Kiss ass.  Ok, probably going to go late tonight.  Burning the midnight tequila.  So, I think you could all just take off now.
Michael, shouldn’t take more than an hour.
Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
Oh, no, that’s alright.  I wanna leave straight from there.
It’s just a couple blocks away, so… boy, you really don’t know Scranton, do you?
You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-
Jan Levinson-Gould.  Jan is cold.  If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn’t moving, you might think she was dead.
We should come up with a signal of some sort.
Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-
What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?
You’re gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.
Thought that was you.  Hi.  Michael Scott.  This is Jan Levinson-Gould.
No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?
Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I’m so sorry.  Excuse me.
Wow, you’re kidding me!  Do you wanna talk about?
Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
Right.  Well, Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years.  So for us, the name of the game is budget reduction-
[to Christian] I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say?   They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?
Ok, it’s done. Actually, [turns around] Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome?  Now it’s done.
Very very funny joke the other day.  Wanna hear it?
Christian, you don’t have to listen to this.
Just one joke.  Ok.  Well, if it’s just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke.  Umm… let’s see… choo choo choo.
Pam, it’s Michael.  I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
[to Michael on speakerphone] Ok, you want me to read ’em?
Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-
Nope.  Told it.  Not as good as you think.  Pick another one.
Ok.  There’s a transcript between a naval ship-
Oh ho ho, yea!  Bingo! And a lighthouse.  Yes.  That is hysterical.  Could you start that one from the beginning?
Sure.  There’s a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael’s screenplay on Jim’s desk]
It is a screenplay.  Starring himself.
How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.
Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn’t really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.
First guy says “Well, I’m an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn”.  And the second guy says, “Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort”.  And the third guy says “I gotcha both beat, I’m a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe”.
Ohhh no! [laughs] Oh my God, that’s funny!  I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose!
[to waitress]  Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?
Do we all have our copy of “Threat Level: Midnight”, by Michael Scott?
Alright, let’s get this started.  I’m gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
Ok, you guys should not be doing this.
Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
You took something that doesn’t belong to you.
The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?
[making the mouth on his tie talk]  Yum! Yum yum yum! [Christian laughs]  That’s delicious!  I love it!
We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can’t match.
That’s why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn’t have to just shout non-sense words.  That’s her fault.
Did somebody say “baby back ribs”?  Hmmm? Hmmmmm?
I don’t think Christian has time for that.
[singing] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back [Christian laughs]
[singing] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back-
[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
Not in a thousand years, Catherine.  We work together.  And get off my desk!
Yes, I have acted before.  I was in a production of “Oklahoma” in the seventh grade.  I played the part of Mutey the Mailman.  They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that.  I was good.
If it isn’t my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.
Thank you for noticing.  Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy]
[looks around conference room] You’re joking right?
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.
Michael’s movie?  Two thumbs down. [Smiles] Heh.
A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh… Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface.  Sam, get my luggage.
Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.  And you’re disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who’s Dwigt?
Ok, you know what? I am done with this.  That’s it, the end.
Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
Uh, you don’t speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement.  My uncle bought me some fireworks.  Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.
That’s actually a good idea.  We’ll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry?
So after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise, that I made to her, and take care of her.
Woo, well, this brings us to Jan.  Truth or Dare?  Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.
Oh no, Michael, Michael, please.  No, really.
Oh, so you’re not gonna play?  She’s not playing.
He didn’t want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
No, you were not stupid.  Gould was stupid.  Right?
You were really brave!  You, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists.
You said “World, this is my blood!  It’s red, just like yours.  So love me!”
I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I’m not a complainer.
Nice.  That’s excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
Yes… nice!  I can’t remember the last time someone made me dinner.
Uh- [Michael signals for her to shh]
I don’t know.  I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me half way, ok, because they’re expecting me to make cuts.
Well, corporate’s gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?
So, I guess I’ll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.
What are you going to do with your time off?
Travel.  I’ve been looking forward to it.  It’s gonna be… really nice.  Gonna find myself.
[points to Jim’s iPod] You have new music?
Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.
I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let’s go.
Goin’. Ok.  Where we goin’?  Doesn’t matter.  Goin’ to the go go. [nervous laugh] Oh-ok.
This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
Jan didn’t come back for her car last night.
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
Oh, I don’t know… [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God.  This is Jan’s cell.
I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR.  My question:
Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.
Dinner and a show, if you include Michael’s movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
You’re right, we didn’t dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.
Least I didn’t leave you at a high school hockey game.
Ok, we didn’t dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it’s not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?
Have you ever heard of Doctor David Friendly?
[throwing away food from the fridge] Not today, Kevin.  Cannot be around carbs today.  You know what one loaf of bread would do to my abs?
I’m almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation.
And, uh, hmm, excuse me, I’ve also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at four p.m.
Uh, I have a pajama party.  At the Playboy Mansion.  With the bunnies.
Michael.  I need you to take this seriously.
Meeting confirmed.  Would you like your confirmation number?  Please grab a pen, because I will only be repeating this once.
[sighs] I’ll see you in ten minutes.
I don’t know, I think I was just staring at my desk.
Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go.
Do you think they’ll get the account. [Stanley stares at her] How come you never answer me?
I’m sorry, Phyllis.  No, I don’t think they’ll get the account.
[reading screenplay] Bullets are flying everywhere.  Ooo, wait, last page, big finish.  Here we go. Agent Michael Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop.
A kick and a chop are two totally different things.
Yeah, now it doesn’t make any sense.
Don’t jump Agent Scarn! There are no parachutes!
Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.
Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute.
I have to say, I think this is a terrible movie.
Do you even know what this is?  It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.  Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim’s desk] Sorry.
Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.
Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that.
Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
Wow.  Um, ok. [pops Dwight’s orb with scissors]
It’s performance review day, company-wide.  Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds.  So, I don’t really know what to expect.
Uh, just off the top… I think she’ll be here this afternoon.
[playing Jan’s message] “I guess I missed you.” I guess I missed you.  So, she misses me?
But then she goes on to say “that will be our only topic of discussion”.  That doesn’t mean anything, those are just words.
Well I don’t think you’re gonna be very happy with this.
Ohhh, great.  Well, now I’m in a terrible mood.  Let’s do your performance review-
Because she’s conflicted.  She has to be professional, but she’s fighting feelings… for you.
Ah, why, that’s great news?   That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?
Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.
Oh, wow, wow.  Alright, let’s listen to that again. [plays Jan’s message] “Michael, it’s Jan.  I guess I missed you”.
Oh, hey, listen, Jim.  Here’s a little tip for your performance review.
Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
We don’t have double-tabbed manila file folders.
Yeah, it’s a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and he’ll be sure to give you a raise.
Alright… well, I’m not asking for a raise. I’m gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?
Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don’t have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don’t call me, and we’ll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.
Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it’s Friday.  And that’s what I’ll be working on this afternoon.
Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
Oh, yes.  Let’s listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses.
God, Stanley, that’s frickin’ brilliant. How do you know that?  Did you learn that on the streets?  Sorry.
Oh, no, that’s ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact.
Michael and Jan definitely made out.
Eck!… Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it’s Friday.  So, keep that goin’.
Good work, Stanley. Great performance review.  Stanley in the house, everybody.  Woo!  Angela, your turn.
I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.
Interesting.  Jan is calling me.  Maybe it wasn’t so mutual after all. [puts Jan on speakerphone] Yeah?
Jan!  To what do I owe this pleasure?
Well, hello to you, too.  Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili’s.
No. No, we won’t be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili’s.
Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
Um, I don’t see how that’s unprofessional. Just-
They are not.  Yes, they are. [Jan hangs up]  That’s my girlfriend.
Don’t talk about it.  Office romances are nobody’s business but the people involved.
Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do.  I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.  Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?  In a folder?  A “Michael-idea” folder?
That’s unfortunate.  How ’bout the suggestion box?  There’s tons of ideas in there.
The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?  Maybe there’s prizes?
Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.
Don’t you mean constructive criticism?
You said “constructive complements”; that doesn’t make any sense.
Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. ‘K?
[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a…
[pumps fist] …Saturday, so just let me know what you’re doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
[on phone]  We’ll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam]  Could you please tell Michael that I’m here?
Ok. [tries to kiss Jan’s hand] Ok, why don’t we just step into my office?  We’re gonna go in here.
Yep, right after you.  Apres-vous. [mouths to Pam] No calls.
You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  I’m not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
This is a business question. It’s nothing personal, I promise.
Are you wearing a new perfume today?
Well, you’re wearing it at the office. And [smells Jan] it, I’m sorry, but no offense, but it’s really sexy.
Oh my God, did you see “The Apprentice” last night?
Course, it’s on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?
I don’t understand- [phone rings] Hold on.  Sorry. [answers]  Yes, Pam.
Michael, it’s time for the suggestion box meeting.
I’m kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn’t interrupt.
You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
I did not, not, not use those words.
Uh, I’d like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now?
Everyone’s waiting in the conference room.
What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
I thought you read these every week.
Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. [to Jan] That happens occasionally.
And, um, one down.  Next suggestion:
Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she’s shooting herself in the head] Pow.
Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion.
Arrr, dooby dooby do. “You need to do something about your B.O.”
You need to do something about your B.O.
Ok, I don’t know who this suggestion is meant for, but it’s more of a personal suggestion and it’s not an office suggestion.  Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.
Aren’t the suggestions meant for you?
Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.
Uh, Michael, he wasn’t inferring, he was implying.  You were inferring.
Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don’t think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
Sometimes you talk to us real close.
Yeah, is that hard for you?  Alright, well-
Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.
“Don’t sl-“, ok, that’s blank [Dwight picks up note] Don’t, just put it-
“Don’t sleep with your boss”? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
I don’t understand why you’re so upset.
You’re gonna sit here and I’m gonna go sit over there.
I just don’t understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
Because nothing did, Michael.  It, I’m not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
I’m sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?
I am ready for my performance review.
Ok, great.  Your performance has been adequate.  You may leave; goodbye.
Is this how you’ve been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.
Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
Why on earth would we give you a raise?
That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word:
That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man’s heart.
I’d also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
Ok, third wheel, why don’t you do that?
For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
It’s a delicacy.  And you know what?  It’s an aphrodisiac.  So when we’re done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
[Dwight opens door] Thank you, Dwight.
Look, I know it’s your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I’m not gonna discuss it with him, I’m certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?
And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said “Dad, you have no idea what I’m capable of”.
Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.
Do you think Michael and Jan actually…
I don’t really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
Um, you don’t, I don’t think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?
I’m heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?
Michael, now is not the time or the place.
Ok, so you’re saying that there is a different time or place?
No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
Well, ok, well never as in ‘never ever ever’, or never as in there’s still a chance?
Never, for me, always means ‘never ever ever.’
I just want to know, from the horse’s mouth, what is the dealio?
With your looks, ok?  It’s your personality.  I mean, you’re obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don’t agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.
Really.  You’re, you’re, you’re a great guy, ok?
And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I’m looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but… ok?
So my looks have nothing to do with it?
Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesn’t matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; I’m good.  I can go home now.
Hey, it’s 12:20; where the hell’s Dwight?
[Jim bows to Pam; she bows back] Thank you.
[running through parking lot] I’m here! I’m here! I’m here! It’s ok!
Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I’m a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn’t take it. And I don’t have a good answer for him, when he asks me.
Yes, I’m in accounting and I’m sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.
So, good, good, good. Something to work toward, being here more. I’m a big believer in people being here more.
I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.
Yeah, magnificent worker, marvelous worker, more money for this worker. Man, I like this worker. Mighty worker.  That’s good. That’s good.
I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.
Kind of, yeah. Over the shirt, my elbow, but…
Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?
So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I’m saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn’t he?
I didn’t, you know, it was… It was dark, for one thing.
Office romances. Um… [laughs] I think you should probably ask Pam ’cause she’s in an office romance, technically.
It’s next. Just keep it. “Look on the supply shelf.” What? What is that? All right, Ryan, look on the supply shelf, would you?
Okay, field trip’s over. Come on. Could we please get back to this?
[clapping] Come on. Let’s get back to this.
All right, don’t break any lands-speed records getting back, okay, Stanley?
“Look under the sink in the men’s room.”
“Don’t…” Okay, that’s blank. Don’t. Just…
“Don’t sleep with your boss.” Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.
Oh, my God. When Dwight said no one wants to come in on a Saturday…
I almost lost it. That was too good.
Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today’s paper on my desk.
What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.
Bet you I got mine for less than yours.
Getting a little something that calm the nerves?
For the performance review. Oh, wait, you don’t get one. You’re a temp.
Why would I lie about a performance review?
Why would Michael give you one before me?
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping]
Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It’s stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It’s cool, it fell.
Never for me always means never, ever, ever.
Maybe I did. Maybe I  called him, I don’t know.
How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.
I didn’t do that. I… Maybe he called me.
Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?
There’s no time to think about if this is real.  Just, shh, everybody. [knock at the front door]
The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected…
That just means you have to enter your password.
Ok, I’m sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?
Look, Michael, I know you don’t want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  I’m in the best shape of my life.  Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr!  That’s strong!
Yeah, but that doesn’t matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok?  Why don’t you just go… away?
There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees.  His salary, that would depress them.  His bed, it—  And I am not going to tell them that I’ll be reading their e-mails.
Hey, what’s the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?
Oh, no, everybody; Oscar’s gone crazy!  What other ghost stories do you have for us?  That I’m a robot? [robot voice]  I will destroy everything in my path-
Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.  [Tin Man voice] Oil can. Oil can.
Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you’re doing e-mail surveillance.
Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.
So it’s true?  You have access to our e-mails?
The problem is that when people hear the term “big brother”, they immediately think it’s scary or bad, but I don’t. I think, wow, I love my big brother.
I gotta erase a lotta stuff.  A lot of stuff.
Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
[whispers to Jim] Hey.  Something just happened.  Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
It’s like squishing a spider under a book.  It’s gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it’s really dead.  Sooo… [to camera guys] If you guys see anything… ?
Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.
One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental.  Who do you think he should choose?
Does he have access to their medical records?
Meredith has an E-vite from Jim.  Barbeque at Jim’s tonight.  Tonight?  Wonder where my e-vitation is.  Click on guest list.  Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed.  Must be… .[scrolls down list] No.
Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim’s party tonight?
No. I mean, I don’t know, I don’t think so.
Hmm… [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me.
[to Michael]  Are you gonna eat with us?
Of course.  Hangin’ with my crew, crew that I am one of.  Hangin’ with my Cup of Noodles.  This is a meal in a cup.
Hot, tasty.  Reminds me of college.  Lived on this stuff.  Brain food.  Mmmm… You know what I really, really miss about college?  The parties.  Everybody’d go.  The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
The professors would go to the parties?
Yeah!  They were the most fun.  We always invited them.
Because not everybody knows about the party.
So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
[laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy’s gonna come, or…
One more hour.  Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don’t know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don’t, we could hang out.
Because you said “do you wanna hang out”-
Tonight, I can’t do it tonight, no.  Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-
It’s the best.  It’s the best.  I would not miss it for the world.  But if something else came up, I would definitely not go.
Hey, Pam.  Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?
Alright.  Oscar, got big plans tonight with-
Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight?  Where are you off to?
My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy.  Where you rushin’ off to?
That’s, whatever stupid show you want-
Unfortunately, I’ve got plans. I have to go to practice.  Soccer practice.
I didn’t know you played soccer, Dwight.
Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that you’re doing, and I’ll see you Monday. [to the camera]  He has no idea!
Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody’s attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it’s not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?
Thanks.  Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions.  Jim, come here.
Great. [to a group of guests]  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
Uh, actually, I haven’t talked to her in a while.
Ok, let’s get right into it.  I need two people for the first scene.
[In Horshack voice from ‘Welcome Back, Kotter’] Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air.
Ok, Michael.  And… anybody?  How about Mary-Beth?  Come on. Ok, so you start us off Mary-Beth.
[fake kicks in door] Boom! Detective Michael Scarn.  I’m with the FBI.
Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life?  Somebody has a gun. [gasps]  That’s why I always start with a gun, because you can’t top it, you just can’t.
I’m supposed to meet my doctor here?  Have ya seen him?  He’s a very angry midget.
You can’t just shoot everyone in the scene.
Well, if you hadn’t stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going.
Ok, what about the scene they set up?
No. No. Michael, I want you to give me all the guns you have.
Just, I want you to get rid of all your guns and give them to me.  Great.
See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It’s-
Down.  You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.
Ok, wait, so that would make me [walks to side of room] like right here.
Yeah, that… Yep, that feels about right.
You know what?  Let’s just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.
Yeah, you don’t have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that’s not gonna be awkward at all.
You wanna go over the rules one more time?
No, no, no.  I’m looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.
I promise it’s worthit .  Ooo, I can see you walking out of here and you’re thrilled with your reading.
He told me he couldn’t show it to me, but he has a gun.
Ok, let’s call it a day.  Nice job, Bill.
Good, it’s good.  Good work, everybody.
I didn’t think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
Yeah, it surprised us all.  I’ll tell you why.  Because when they—
I’m sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  There’s gotta be something else we can talk about.
I think it’s alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears]
Hey Phyllis, come here for a second.
Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
You tell me.  Well, you do mean you and Jim right?  Oh God.  I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you’re talking all the time.  I’m sorry!
[smacks Ryan’s hand]  Not so fast… Fire Guy.
How do I get to Bernie’s Tavern from here?
Oh, don’t worry.  We’re all gonna carpool.
So Bernie’s, huh?  We’re all going to Bernie’s? [to camera]  Go to Bernie’s?
Oh sorry, we’re not going as a group, it’s just a private friend who just happens to know all of us from different ways is throwing a private birthday thing.
Right, right, right.  Well guys, I’d love to go to Bernie’s with you, but, you know, I have an office party.  A big office party I need to go to, so…  Can’t get out of it.
Ok, see you later.  Nice job, Bill.  Not.
[singing] Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road I’ve ever known…
Oh by the way how’s your side project going?
Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.
Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn’t mean that they’re together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.
[singing]  Just turn around now, cause you’re not welcome anymore.
[singing] It requires a dedication, all this love we feel needs no conversation.  Divided, together, uh huh.  Making love with each other, uh huh.
[singing] Islands in the stream, that is what we are, no one in between, how can we be wrong?  Sail away with me…
[Oscar shakes his leg] You’re going to have to stop that. [Oscar moves over] I can still feel it.
Do you have a question or something?
Nope, nope.  I actually wear a turban sometimes.  Wanna see it?
Got it right here. [pulls out Karnak turban]
Comedy; it’s funny.  It’s Johnny Carson, Karnak.  It’s, um, put it back.  Huhhhh, did you have Johnny Carson in your land?
In Pittsburgh?  Yeah, but I never really watched him.
No, I’m much younger than you.  I watched Conan.
Alright, I’m gonna, uhh, get a cup of coffee.  Do you want some coffee er-
You don’t even know what I’m talking about.
Should have done this a long time ago.  Tons of personal e-mails, huge time wasters.  Uh, uh huh.  Wow, like Kevin, rating the best bars in Scranton?  Poor Richard’s number seven?  Idiot.  Stupid load.  [phone rings]  Yeah.
Hey, Michael, accounting needs your approval on-
Yeah, I’m busy right now. [hangs up]
Here’s a helpful suggestion for Jim.  Jim, instead of e-mailing Amazon, to try and get that CD that you didn’t receive, I suggest that you go to Visa and tell them to cancel the charge.
Yeah, definitely didn’t need help with that, but, yeah.
Jim.  Lots of e-mails to Amazon, lots of wasted computer space.  Alright, let’s get back to work.
Yeah, I assumed Michael was already doing this.  That’s why I only use my personal e-mail account.
[moves chair to Jim and Dwight’s desks] Ooo, bleh bleh bleh.
I don’t know.  Just felt like taking it off.  Man, work can be just so damn frustrating don’t ya think, Jim?
What’s going on, Michael.  Talk to me.
I don’t know, same old stuff.  Same old.  Boss just been ridin’ my ass.
I don’t wanna talk about it.  I just wanna hang out, just be one of the guys.
That’s exactly the point.  You’ve hit a slump. It happens to the best of us.  You just have to remember, you know-
Where you come from, and who you are.
You know, you have worked so hard for this.  You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.
Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.
No, this is completely the time, this is perfect time.  This is just guys gently ribbing each other, it’s what it’s all about, just hangin’ out.  Enjoying friends, all being the same.  Worker bees.
No, just bees, just bees hanging out, buzzing around.
I’m just a bee, Dwight, ok, just a bee, just buzzin’.
Hey, um, I was wondering if it’d be ok if I go to Lonny’s poker game tonight.  I promise, it’ll be like the last time for a while.
We were supposed to go to the barbeque at Jim’s house.
Oh, man.  Um, could you go without me? Make something up, say I like, ate something, or…
Huh, huh?  You’re the best.  You’re the best!
Ok, don’t wake me up cause I’m playing ball in the morning.
Alright, bye. [Pam looks around the office]
[to the cameraman] Did I miss anything?
I have a right mind to shoot you right in the head.
I, I killed him. You’re right! It was me!
Just shut up!  I don’t wanna hear anything more from you.
Alright, I’ll be quiet if we can make some kind of deal.  A deal?
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!  No deal.  Not with Michael Scarn, FBI.  Michael Scarn doesn’t make deals.  Michael Scarn shoots and then asks questions later. [blows on his fake gun]
She was kind of tripping me up, cause she was, um, I was trying to get something going, when I was over her with the gun, and she like kept changing the story.
Going into nuclear something; that’s not where the scene was going.
Well, it goes, it goes in the best direction, and that was not the best direction.
I felt like he was ordering me around, cause he-
Well, he, Michael Scarn, that character, orders people around, and that’s, you should of just gone-
All your characters order people around though, and-
I don’t think there’s any stronger choice than being a really strong character.
We’ve seen you do that character before though.  I mean, you know, that’s cool.
Well, it’s, like, well, it’s, you know, when refine it, refine a character down to its essence,  that’s…
Nah, I know, I just meant that… he shot me, I just-
Or Ryan Stiles, something like that.
Yeah, ya know maybe, he made me get on the ground, and I didn’t feel safe in this game.
You shouldn’t have been, ’cause you were dealing with Michael Scarn.  That was exactly what I was hoping to achieve, so that is probably the best thing you could have said, that’s a compliment.
And he’s really into penguins or something?
Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don’t know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.
Oh, I’m sorry.  I gave you a penguin.
And that’s why it’s on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more.  Moving on!  Uh, ok, so that’s the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends:
I’ll just throw out some suggestions.
Ok, you guys wanna start? [to Michael]  Don’t throw out any-
And he’s a proctologist. [to teacher] What?
We don’t need a suggestion for this one; it’s gonna come from them. [to other students] It’s a game called “Yes, and?” and uh, you will say the first sentence.  And uh, you’re telling a story-
Why don’t you turn it up? [Ryan moves to turn up the grill]  Uh! Not so fast… Fire Guy.  Think we need some more heat, Fire Guy?  Hey, Fire Guy, maybe we should burn Jim’s house down.
You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don’t break the branches, Dwight.
Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! [laughs] Nice, huh?
I’ve got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.
On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.
One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.]
[holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?
A, that’s what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That’s what Christmas is all about.
Is there anything we’re missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
[comes into the conference room in a Santa hat and beard]  Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, [points to Ryan] pimp. I’m kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?
Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
You do realize that we can’t serve liquor at the party.
Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.
One, two, three. [they lift and start to move a desk]
[having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me?
Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
Well, I’m sorry. It just doesn’t work.
Michael, I would like to be the elf.
That makes sense because he has elfish features.
I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.
I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don’t know anything about Creed. I know his name’s Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he’s Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.
I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn’t [smiles happily].
Well, I can’t tell you cause it’s a secret.
I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.
I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.
Well, there’s a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
That’s great. Well don’t tell me who it is, cause I can ..
Gather round. Secret Santa, let’s go. Let’s go. Come on. Stanley, no, I’m going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.
All right, let’s count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?
Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]
Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let’s do Secret Santa.
Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It’s like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, “Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.”
[rips off the wrapping] Shower radio. Neat.
Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..
Okay. Okay. That’s enough. Let’s keep it moving on. Jim.
He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.
[opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It’s awesome.
All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present]
[unwraps present] Whoa, a video iPod.
Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.
Wasn’t there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn’t matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?
Oh hey, for me. What is in here? [opens a handmade oven mitt] Oh, come on.
So Phyllis is basically saying, “Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt’s worth.” I gave Ryan an iPod.
Should we just keep opening up the presents?
We don’t do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.
One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person’s gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else’s gift or choose a new gift.
I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.
Because it’s better. Because it’s more special.
Shut it. No, it’s not. Okay, just give it a shot.
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He’s not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry]
Okay, Meredith is up first. Here’s the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else’s gift that they’ve already gotten, like the oven mitt.
Oh, shouldn’t we … I bought that specifically for Pam.
Yankee Swap! That’s what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
And I have to give it to her? I don’t have a choice?
Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
[after Ryan opens a new gift – a nameplate saying ‘Kelly’] That was meant for Kelly.
That’s like, the creepiest thing that I’ve ever seen.
I’ll take the poster. Some people like these.
Everyone wants the iPod. It’s a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.
Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.
Okay, moving along. Meredith, let’s go.
It’s already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
[holding oven mitt] I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It’s beautiful.
Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.
Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don’t know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.
[opens present] “In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute.”
Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
I never said it was better than an iPod.
Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.
[shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!
That’s the thing I bought myself. I’m really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.
Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets … Christmas.
[after Phyllis leaves suddenly] What is she so upset about?
Maybe because you hated her present so much.
Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it’s a success and I’m the one who ended up with Dwight’s stupid paintball pellets.
Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
Well, I didn’t. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!
It wasn’t. It wasn’t that much. It was $3,000.
Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party’s so lame.
All right, now, you’re the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?
Fifteen bottles of vodka? Yeah, that should do it.
I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
Come on, it’s a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
“A real man makes his own luck.” Billy Zane.
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?
True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..
.. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]
To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it’s a little too much to handle.
I know. It’s totally going to change the way I work out.
Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don’t have to. I’m gonna save a ton of money.
So what are you going to get me instead?
I don’t know. Probably like, a sweater or something.
Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.
This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.
We’re really not supposed to serve alcohol.
Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it’s a party. Come on. If I can’t throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?
The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year’s resolution that I’m not going to drink anymore. During the week.
Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?
I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.
Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I’m done.
It’s possible. I can’t believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man.
Come on! Shaun Alexander? He’s the best back in the league.
Anybody making out in here? [checks hallway] Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. [takes picture of Jim] Okay, how’s it going in here? [takes picture of Meredith and Kevin]
We’re running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
No, no, no, no. We’ll find some, don’t leave the party.
Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.
Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.
You know, you don’t have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
[laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot]
I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..
Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
[opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
Yeah, I think I made the right choice.
Oh, my God! It’s incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer?
I didn’t think you were going to get that one. I really didn’t.
Not bad. And if it couldn’t go to Ryan, you are the guy I’d want it to go to.
[grabbing Michael around the neck] Merry Christmas, asswipe!
No way. Oh, you’re kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!
[rapping] What’s up my nerds. Check it out. [points at the mistletoe stuck down his pants]
Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.
Oh, let’s fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby’s gonna fix you up.
[listening to music through headphones] Yeahhh.
Darryl. There you go. [hands him the Santa hat] You earned it.
No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.
[looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?
[coming out of his office] Lampshade on head! It’s happening!
[as Jim decorates a passed out Todd Packer] Oh, no.
Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?
You shouldn’t do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
Oh, hey. Listen up. We’re going to Poor Richard’s. Who’s in?
Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard’s?
Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let’s head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?
Towards me. That’s good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I’m good. I’m good, I’m good.
Do you want me to help you with that?
Phyllis and Angela and Meredith are helpers. I guess Angela’s kind of… Angela’s little. Phyllis and Meredith are not little. Pam is sort of a medium helper.
Okay. Christmas lights? Good. Tinsel? Good. Star? Good.
Dwight is… Dwight looks like Spock to me. He always wears the ears, and I always give him grief about looking like Spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be Spock, for some reason.
Question, Pam. Is Roy coming to the party?
Okay, well, you didn’t tell me that. Now, he will not be allowed in unless we register him on this list.
Do I look like I’m kidding? [Pam shakes her head ‘no’] Phyllis, stag, I assume.
I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That’s how we met. [whispers] He’s my boyfriend.
Everyone, please remain calm until we receive further instructions.
Just let us open up the presents, Dwight.
Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.
Well, thank God you didn’t steal my oven mitt. And Oscar, you little gourmand, your turn.
So, I guess, you really didn’t want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.
I don’t know why Oscar didn’t like the gift. I know he wanted a shower radio. I mean, I totally remember him telling me that he wanted one.
Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower.
I guess I’ll take the last gift. Cool.
It was supposed to be for Meredith, ’cause she said she likes my drawings.
Thanks. I wish I could’ve had it. Do you wanna trade?
Yeah. Like anybody would want an oven mitt. [Phyllis gets up and leaves the party]
Yes, totally, ’cause I was just gonna throw this out anyway.
Really? You were gonna throw out a book?
[Rap music playing] [singing] The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer My name’s DMC with the mike in my hand And I’m chilling and cooling just like a snow man
[singing] So open eyes Lend us an ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year [Darryl whooping] Yeah.
I’m the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party.
I do enjoy a drink now and again, but tonight, no. I am also an officer of the law and I’m unofficially on the clock. I need to stay sober and alert. Also, on a personal note, I’m not at my best when I drink.
I actually got that for you. I had you originally.
Oh, cool. It looks really interesting. What did you end up with? [Ryan pulls Creed’s old coat out of a bag] Sorry.
I didn’t want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.
I love it. I actually used to have a radio show back in the ’70s.
You’re kidding. What was your DJ name?
Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy.
This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
Wow, that’s weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that’s pretty good.
Yeah, well, I’m not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you’re friends with the vending machine guy.
Sorry. What do I want? What do I want… Oh, it’s a pencil cup.
No, no, no, no, no. That’s my pencil cup.
Um, I don’t think so, I just bought it.
Uh, I think so, and you’re going to hand it over to me.
Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
[putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five…
Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.
“It’s time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.”
So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn’t it?
Should my wife tell her boss she’s not coming in tomorrow?
Well, no. But… okay, don’t spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.
This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I’m going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.
It is now time to unveil the destination of this year’s retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It’s a booze cruise!
I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
No. This is mandatory. But don’t worry, you know what? You’re gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.
Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.
Leader… ship. The word “ship” is hidden inside the word “leadership,” as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we’re all in the same boat. Teamwork!
Last year, Michael’s theme was “Bowl over the Competition!” So guess where we went.
Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?
How about the sales department is the sails?
Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.
I’m not really sure what movie you’re talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
I think you’re thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he’s king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.
No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They’re happy down there in the furnace room. And they’re dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they’re singing their ethnic songs, and… actually, that might be warehouse.
The… no, no. No, I didn’t… okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I’m saying is… leadership. We’ll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.
[singing] A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.
Actually, I’m the Skipper. But you can be Gilligan.
I’d rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.
I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I’m also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship. [to boarding passengers] Hi, welcome aboard.
In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It’s nebulose.
Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack.
And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!
They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat.
But don’t worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.
I’m your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna…
If the boat’s a-rockin’, don’t come knockin’!
Your company’s employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay?
We’re all gonna have a good time tonight!
Why don’t you let me and my crew do our job. You just sit back and have a good time. All right?
You guys, it’s like we’re in high school and we’re at the cool table. Right?
No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!
Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You… you really look familiar. Did you… you cheered for them, didn’t you?
Yes, I did! [chanting] A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We’re the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!
I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!
Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.
When are you going to start the presentation?
Not now, Mike, we’re doing the limbo! That’s right, partiers, it’s time to limbo, limbo, limbo!
All right! I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick. Who’s it gonna be?
Hey, I got an idea! How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight?
Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I’m counting on you!
I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.
All right, all right, that was great! Now it’s time for the dance contest!
But before that, I have to do my presentation.
All right, we’ll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!
Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that’s always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.
[singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
I can’t. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!
[chanting] Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot!
Whoo! Who’s next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!
Hey, why don’t we find like a quieter place to hang out?
I’ve just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!
It’s getting kind of rowdy down there.
Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
I mean, I don’t know. So… what’s it like dating a cheerleader?
So, what’s this presentation all about?
Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?
No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.
Okay, well, obviously you don’t know anything about leadership.
Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm.
Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He’s let me steer the ship for the last hour.
I’d like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?
Uh, I’ve been engaged for three years, and there’s no end in sight. So… you don’t wanna ask my advice.
Suppose your office building’s on fire. Jim, who would you save?
Um… let’s see, uh…  The customer. Because the customer is king.
Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.
When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?
Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn’t thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her.
You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
I don’t want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?
Well… could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great!
We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship!
Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!
No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.
What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?
This is where Captain Jack drives the boat.
Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.
Captain Jack is a fart face. I’m on medication.
Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here?
It’s a predicament, and it’s something that each and every one of us has to think about.
I’m in the brig. See? The boat’s not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was… if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.
Captain Jack has a problem with authority.
Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.
Well, it’s nice for you. Your friend got engaged.
Roy said the first one didn’t count.
That’s… great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so…
Really? You’re kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan…
Yeah. She’s really funny, and she’s warm. And she’s just… well, anyway.
Well, if you like her so much, don’t give up.
Don’t worry, Michael. I’m taking us to shore.
Yes, I brought my duffel bag and a sleeping bag.
Where do you guys think we’re going?
Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?
Two ladies at once. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Okay, you heard something. Um, yeah, it’s a booze cruise, but it… There’s more to the story than that. It…
Leadership off-site. Uh, booze cruise is just a rhyme…
Michael, we discussed the IRS’s regulations.
Yeah, I don’t even know why I said booze cruise. I don’t even think there’s booze on the boat.
Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible.
Of course, of course. Yes. Yes. Look, I have a whole program planned. Jan, this program is going to change people’s lives. I am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat.
Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training.
I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches.
Oh, cool. Cool. And maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house for the night. Awkward. That’s… You know what. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?
Jan said if you asked me that I was supposed to say no.
Really? You seriously said that? Okay. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?
Okay, you know, I’m gonna go now, and…
Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.
You call me if you need anything, Brenda.
I’ll call you, too. [to Brenda] So. You are probably gonna get carded, so I can make you a fake ID. We have a laminating machine.
What is a sales department? Oscar, what do you think?
I don’t know what the categories are of workers on a boat.
I’m not giving you the answer. Deck hands is one. And…
No, I’m first mate. You’re second mate. I’m first mate, as the captain.
Well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down. Toby is the anchor. Oh, God. He, well… [to Brenda] Tell you about Toby later, he’s awful.
Yeah, I know Toby from Jan’s birthday.
[Toby running to get on the cruise] Hey! What’s wrong with you? You missed the boat.
No, no, no. That’s his punishment for not being here on time. Too bad, anchor!
I guess I shouldn’t have stopped for dinner.
On the high seas, Captain Jack is the leader. On the land it’s Michael. On the ramp up to the boat, I was a bit conflicted. But now that I’m here, I’ll follow Captain Jack to hell and back.
Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?
You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard…
If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff’s Deputy, and you can count on me.
That’s good to know, Dwight. Thanks.
Hey. You know what the best way of studying is?
Flash cards. Doesn’t really help me right now because I’m on a boat.
You are gonna get seasick if you keep reading in here.
Yeah! All right. All right. That was awesome. All right, looks like the guitar player’s gonna take a little break. So this’d be a great time to head on over to the taco bar. All right.
Do you want me to give it a shot? Just…
You know what? I don’t think it’s in…
That’s not in tune. I don’t know if you can…
…make much of out of it, Creed. Good luck to you. I don’t know. It is a defective ax, my friend.
Guys, E, blues. Follow me, okay? [playing well]
Those slide moves are just bush league. I hope I die before I’m old.
[speaking Spanish] Por favor, tequila seoor.
What you say, bitch? You know, you might be right.
Should have done it a long time ago.
I do what’s right whenever I figure it out. I love you, babe.
Everybody, everybody? There is a toast. Come on…
Thanks, Katy. Um, didn’t really prepare anything to say. We’re all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she’s awesome. And…
Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?
That’s my line! That’s my line, That’s… I always say that at weddings. So I’ll just think of something else to say. I… [band starts playing]
[storms out of Michael’s office] Well, we’re not going to Florida.
Pam! It’s Michael.  Help me!  I need help right now.
I’m hurt, I have hurt myself.  Oh my God!
Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!
Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.
I want to come to work.  But I need you to come and pick me up. [Jim lunges across Pam’s desk and puts Michael on speakerphone]
It’s, okay, it’s Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.
Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.
Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?
Michael, you should stay home and rest.
There’s no toilet paper here.  Could Ryan… tell Ryan to bring toilet paper.  Could you tell ’em that?
I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
[panicked] No one wants to pick me up!?
[silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?
Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.
Don’t… is that Dwight?  I do not want Dwight.
Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
Michael, why don’t you call your girlfriend?
But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
It was all made up.  Just someone come, ok?  Anyone.  Anyone but Dwight.
[sounds of a car crash] What was that…
What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael’s office window]
Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield]  Ohhhhhh!
He’s still driving… Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
Hellooo? … Please don’t send Dwight!
You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.
No, I didn’t mention that you cooked your foot.
Please stop popping my cast.  Thank you.
So, where are you shipping your foot?
Ha ha ha.  So where are you shipping…
Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and…
No, your job is being my friend, Pam.  OW! God!
It’s just that before, you said that you didn’t want any special treatment.
I don’t want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who’s undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.  I don’t think that’s too much to ask.
Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.
No, I don’t want some aspirin, yeah I’m a little fussy.  Aspirin’s not gonna do a damn thing.  I’m sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.
Hey, Pam, I’m assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.
What?  Part of your duties are to what?
You just said “part of your duties are to” something.
Yes, you did.  What is wrong with you?
Thank you.  Did you get all dark meat like I like?
Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.
Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?
How strange.  Because they always have yams.
Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?
Yeah, they’re like an i-Pod only they’re better ’cause they’re chunkier and more solid.
Roy gave it to me for Christmas.  I’m trying to figure out how to put songs on it.
Oh, no no no.  Don’t go there.  I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.
Yeah, I’ll write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. … Kidding!
Why would they all be…?  Ok, see you later, Pan.
I want you to rub butter on my foot.
Uh, ow.  Ryan! … Ryaaaaan … RYYYYAN!
These covers are totally indestructible.
Yeah. Throw it.  I promise it won’t break.  Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player]
No, it’s fine.  I told you it wouldn’t break.  You could throw it all day long.
So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
Oh God no, Dwight isn’t my friend… Oh my God!  Dwight’s kind of my friend!
No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom.  No, I’m not gonna call Jan.  She’d just worry… drive down here and make a big thing… Who told you that?  No, it was mutual.  What is Pam doing chatting with you?
What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing]
You know, around age twelve, I just started goin’ for it.
[loud noise in bathroom] No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!
I fell off the toilet.  I’m caught between the toilet and the wall.
Ugh, not you.  Someone else.  Get Pam.
I don’t think Pam’s gonna want to come into the men’s room.
Get Ryan.  He needs to lift me. [Ryan shakes his head] and he needs to clean me up a little bit.  Bring a wet towel.
No.  Can’t, can’t you just get up yourself?  I… You only grilled your foot.
Ugh, forget it.  I’ll just get up myself.  No!  Uh, aaaahhh!  Ah!  Oh God!
Do you think Dwight’s bein’ a little weird today?
No, he’s actually been really nice and helpful.
Can I have everyone’s attention please?  Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who’s supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question?  Do you all know what it’s like to be disabled?  Oscar?
When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung.
Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I’m sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.
I’m not disabled and neither are you.
Ok, [lifts up cooked foot] what does this look like to you Stanley?!
Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about.  You people are jerks.  Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.
Oh, we wouldn’t.  We love Stevie Wonder.
[sigh] I burned my foot!!!  Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody’s in there!
While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.
Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
Good question.  Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia [points to a picture from Big]:
Yeah, he’s dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.
He grew into a man overnight.  Rare disability, still works. [sigh] A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?
Michael Scott, I’m looking for Michael Scott.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.
Sorry I’m late.  Someone parked in the handicapped parking space.
Hey everyone, I’m Billy Merchant, you may have seen me around here before, I’m the properties manager of this office park
Thank you. Actually, I’ve been meaning to come by here for a long time…
But it’s hard for you! Right? Because you’re in a wheelchair.
No, I just have a lot of properties to manage.
Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?
Oh my God, that’s three times as long as it takes me.
This morning?  Just like every other morning, just climbed on in. [Everyone laughs]
Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.
Hey, hey, relax, just jokin around here.
Well, that’s good, he still has a sense of humor.
Listen, I’ve actually used a chair since I was four years old.  I don’t really notice it anymore.
Well they notice it.  Don’t you?  You notice it.  It’s the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn’t it?
I want to clamp Michael’s face in a George Foreman grill.
So, there are just a couple things I want to remind everybody of…
First is parking.  You can’t block the freight entrance with your car, even if your blinkers are on.  Does anybody have any questions? [to Dwight, whose arms is raised]  Yes. Yeah? yes…
Ignore him.  You know what?  We’re not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick…
Did you see Born on the Fourth of July?  I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.
You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
No, not Michael.  The moon-faced kid who crashed into the pole.  He looks like he has a concussion.
I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
You did it!  Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin.  Very nice.  Thank you, Ryan.
No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
[sigh] Ok, I’ll just have the pudding.
You know what?  I feel better.  Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
Yeah, baby, I am feelin’ better.  My body’s literally healing itself.  It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.
I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael’s pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.
[hits his head on his desk]  Uh, ugh, ohhhh…
Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I’m pretty sure he has a concussion.
Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.
He needs to go right now, and you’re his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.
I can’t take you, I don’t have my car and yours is all vomity.
Oh, ok, that’s, great.  No, I can’t drive.  Jim why don’t you drive.
We’ll go.  I’m still recovering. So let’s just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.
Slowly, slowly.  Let’s just get to the elevator.
[Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Tired… [Jim grabs spray bottle from planter]
Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight.
Yes, I know, but it’s gonna be different.
Aw, Pam, you’re adorable [taps her nose]
You don’t think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.  The first person to shout “shotgun” when you’re within the sight of the car gets the front seat.  That’s how  the game’s played.  There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.
Oh, God, a mini-van.  What is Meredith’s problem?
Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.  She’s not gonna find one driving this thing around.
Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I’m so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.
We’re going to the hospital, Michael.
Give the bottle to Michael [sprays Dwight]
Dwight… [to Jim] You just keep your eyes on the road. [to Dwight]  Give me the bottle or you’re fired.
You can’t fire me, I don’t work in this van!
Michael stop. [sprays Michael, then Dwight]
Stop, stop it! Stop spraying! [Dwight whines] Gimme the bottle!
Stop spraying me!  Gimme the bottle!
It’s Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
What do I write under “reason for visit”?
Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?
Nothing.  I wrote “bringing someone to the hospital”.
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
No… you know what Jim, this isn’t about me anymore.  I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. [Dwight falls towards Jim]
Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?
Well, you don’t have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
[to Dwight] So, I’m ordering a CAT scan.
Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
Well, for a burn, you really just need to look at the outside of the foot.
Ok, no electronics past this point.  Camera, sound equipment…
Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.
Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.  We’ll, see you when you get out.
Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?
Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
I can’t believe he’s getting a CAT scan.
Michael went in there with him too.  It’s pretty sweet.
But they shouldn’t be much longer now, so we’ll be back soon.
Ok, that’s uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I’ll let you go.
I just wanted to let you that Dwight’s gonna be ok.  The doctor said there’s a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he’ll probably even be back at work tomorrow.
I just, uh, thought you’d want to know that.
Ok Mr. Schrute, inhale with me on three.  One, two, uh Sir? [Michael tries to put his leg in the scanner] Stop that. Stop. Stop that.
[Jim popping Michael’s bubble wrap cast] You should put butter on it.
Uh, that’s what she said.  See, haven’t lost my sense of humor.  No, no need, it was a non-stick grill.
I’ve had a Foreman grill for about six years, I’ve done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I’ve never burnt myself, probably because I don’t use it as a pillow.
I always keep a stash of bubble wrap at my house.  Some days, hectic, tiring days, I just like to go home and zone out and click on the tube and pop a few.  Very soothing.  [to the interviewer] Want to try?
You know, that’s probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.
Right, I’m gonna spend the day in the hospital, bujehh.  Bureaucracy and germs.
Constructing a home-made cast?  Genius.  Filled with foresight.  Like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane.  They wasted nothing.
Wow, I don’t want to hear… you talk.  Pam, could I have a word with you in my office?  [stumbling] Oh, oh, oh.  Alright.
My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott.
Ooo! Who made popcorn? [Michael rubbing butter on his foot]
[on speakerphone] Well you know, frankly a lot of us have been saying this for a long time.
Yeah, and I, uh, I think that the very fact that we’re including it in our agenda frankly, is a big step forward.
I used to be in HR.  I was a Hell raiser.
Great.  Because you that I think the very fact that [Michael mutes the call]
Ry-an.  You’re here.  Whatcha got, whatcha got?  Alright, Panic Room, Maverick, Nell, Sommersby, The Accused.  Where’s Little Man Tate?
Oh man.  It’s not a Jodie Foster afternoon without Little Man Tate, buddy.
Mmm, I’m telling you the best cure in the world is comfort food.  You know how they say “stuff a cold”?  Well I don’t care you’ve got, the flu, Lyme disease, emphysema, you eat an entire dark meat chicken, you can walk on the moon.
Look, I feel fine.  As a volunteer sheriff’s deputy I have been trained to notice all the signs of a concussion.  One of them is slurred speech, ok?  Number three, shortness of breath.  There are four things you have to remember.  One:
We need to get your friend into the CT machine.
Into a machine?!  Ok. Uh, that’s bad, will you stay with me?
Ok, will you please call my cousin Mose?
No, I’m not calling your weirdo cousin.  Twenty-seven years old, never left the beet farm.
Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where’s the funny? Give it to me.
Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that’s brilliant!
Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?
Mmm, what flavour coffee is that?  Up-dog?
I don’t know, nothin’, what’s up with you?
Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?
Gotcha! [laughing] Oh, God. [low] Crap! Nothin’ how ya doing?
No, that’s not… no, that’s not what I was going to say.
Meredith, men’s room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes.  They’re worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?
I agree it’s unacceptable. [longing look]
What difference does it make whether your here?
Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?
Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
Really? Oh, that is a shame.  You know it’s cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.
Ask him his symptoms. I’m on Web M.D.
I feel nauseous and my heads killing.
Michael is there anything you need from me? I’d like to go back to bed.
I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday.  Unless you’re still sick.  So have a great long weekend.
I’ll just be sleep— [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish]
Which is exactly how you’d wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
Yeah. Drop what you’re doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can’t function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
Listen, you don’t have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?
Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don’t know, like loose with big curls and…
You’d look like an angel. I’m seriously going to cry.
Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don’t you wear your hair like that all the time.  It’s much sexier. [Pam puts hair back up] [Michael walks by Jim] Man, this must be torture for you.
Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world’s worst confidant.
Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That… was… personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.  And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.
My lips are sealed. [singing] My lips are sealed… Bangles.
[singing] Can you hear me, they talk about us…
Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I’m no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning.  Do you think you can handle it?
Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?
Any of em?  So, uh, what’s the 411? Any news on the “P” situation?
Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?
Alright, well, cool. [Michael walks by Jim] Still deciding?
[Michael presses a button for Stanley] Peach iced tea. You’re going to hate it.
Tony the tiger.  You don’t hear that much any more.
Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.
Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.
Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
Um, I don’t know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth.
Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick.  What are you doin’ for lunch?
I don’t know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim’s desk], no way, no. Why don’t, why don’t I take you out to lunch? My treat.
No, that’s alright, thank you though. It’s, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room.  Have a little picnic order some ‘za. Talk about you know who.
Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let’s go out. That was a good idea.  Let’s go out.
[at Hooters] Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?
Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.
Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o’clock. Hi.
We’re not worthy. We’re not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.
I’m his boss actually.  And I treat him well. I’m taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?
Oh, it’s great. It’s served with our world famous wing sauce.
Mmmm, sounds yummy.  I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken. [Giggles]
No, I’m gonna have the gourmet hot dog.
So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?
Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don’t know.
Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
Ok, good, thank you.  That wasn’t so hard now was it?
Uh, I really don’t want to talk about it.
Um, she’s easy to talk to I guess and she’s got a really good sense of humor.
And I understand we have a birthday today.
You put your front side in; you put your front side out. You put your front side in and shake it all about. You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around. That’s what it’s all about. Whoo, hoo!
[Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature.
Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
Just go to his house and see if he’s sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.
If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And I’d forget too.
[Michael messes up hair to look like Jim’s] Expenses.
No. It’s… I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?
No he did not. I don’t need his permission.
You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?
Uhhh it’s ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don’t understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?
I put a cigarette through a freakin’ quarter.  And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.
Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related?
You’re not his friend, you don’t know. He is in love with a girl he works with who’s engaged.  So just cut me some slack. Please?
Angela who would you choose Jim or Roy?
It’s nobody’s business, Phyllis. Roy.
Well she’s the… Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam… and me.
Jim, why didn’t you tell me you had a crush on Pam?
Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don’t. Riveting.
Did you find anything good in your desk?
It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It’s so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
And seriously, it’s totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.
No, I mean, just ’cause we like got along so well.
So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?
And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
Stay low… This is it… There he is. He’s been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa… Oh yes. Let’s roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what’s going on here. You weren’t sick at all.
This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?
How bout this. I don’t tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.  Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just… I know. I’m just, I just hope that, I just hope that [starts to get choked up] this doesn’t affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.
Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it’s, you know what. It’s not a big deal.
Ok, I’m fine, no I know, I’m good, I’m good, it’s just.
Look its one day, everything’s gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
Creed did you organize the menu book?
Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis.
Oh, I thought it was a volunteer thing.
Hey, here’s your schedule for next week. Are you okay?
Yeah I’m fine. Look, about you and Jim.
No, I feel it’s my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
No, really, it’s okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.
It wasn’t that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.
Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I’m done. That’s it. I’m out.
Oh, Pam with the dirty talk. [laughs]
And he’s lining it up. Seems pretty straightforward from here. If Michael Scott sinks it, he’ll win a Buick signed by Tiger Woods.
No, he meant to put it right next to the hole, that’s much harder to do.
Interception. He shoots, he scores, yeah! Michael, try it like this. This’ll be much harder.
No, no, no, no. I don’t want to chip my mug. Please get that off the floor. [sets mug on the edge of Michael’s desk]
All right. Jack Nicholson for birdie.
[golf ball rolls under bookcase] I got it. No problem. [clears throat]
[mug falls off Michel’s desk and smashes on the floor] God… damn it, Dwight! That’s great.
[pulls a brand new mug out of his desk door] That won’t be necessary.
Look at all them out there, my little worker bees buzzing away.
If they’re the worker bees, you’re the Queen bee.
No, King is higher. Then Ace. I am the Ace bee.
People Magazine, crossword puzzle, keep or toss?
18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.” Michael wrote, “Judd?”
Yeah, I rushed a few fraternities, but you know what? I don’t believe in paying for friendships. So, I made a decision not to accept any offers. And fortunately none were made. Which was good, so nobody’s feelings got hurt.
Temp, shouldn’t you be monitoring the progress of people’s cleaning efforts?
Everything seems pretty much under control.
Yeah. Well, I’d hate to see it blow up in your face.
Let’s table that. So, temp… You seem to be pretty close to this Oscar.
You seem a little nervous. You shouldn’t be.
Keep the change. Here you go buddy, happy birthday.
No, you what, seriously, you should have it.
No, no, no, no. I have the long sleeve. And actually, you know what we should do? We should wear them tomorrow to work, it’ll be hysterical.
Oh, tomorrow, that’s gonna be tough ’cause I already laid out my outfit, so…
Okay, Tuesday. Whenever. You’d better try it on, make sure it fits.
Pam’s on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it’ll be nice to see her.  It’ll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh… June.  Summer.  So, that’ll be nice.  And that’s that.
[again catching Jim looking at him] What?
Jim’s been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but it’s nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.
Welcome back!  How was your vacation?
Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.
I am Pam.  Spicoli guy.  Oh, God.  Names, numbers.  Okay. [walking into office] Whoa!  God!  Yuck, yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck!
There is stink in there, my God!  What is… what is that?
[looking at pile on Michel’s carpet] Oh… I don’t know.
Oh, God!  How could that happen?  How could… right in the middle of the carpet.
Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.
[taking a look] I don’t think that’s vomit.
Check it out.  Don’t be a wuss, just get… no, I’m not holding your coffee.
What is it?  No, just tell me what it is.
[pounding on door] Michael, I … I … I gotta get outta here.  I can’t hold my breath that long.
[after going in to check out the smell]  Phew.  Oh!  No, mm-mm. [leaving quickly]
I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
How do you know that?  What is it, then?
[as cleaning lady with mask leaves] Here she comes.  All cleaned?  Great. [walks into office]
So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.
[barely stifling laughter] It wasn’t me.  Um… it wasn’t me. [regaining composure] It was not me.
[sitting at Jim’s desk]  Hey Jim.  I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
But there’s definitely a desk open in the back.
No, no, no!  Seriously, I don’t mind sharing.
No, no, no, seriously, I’ll be in the back.
Um, just for the day while Michael’s at my desk.
Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.
[putting his feet on desk] Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Old bullpen.
[putting his feet on desk] Ha ha ha… the old bullpen.
The pressures of my office are insane.
I just… you couldn’t understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know?  I used to sit right here.
You know who used to sit at that desk?
That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
He was, but, uh… that desk was empty.  He’d come in and sit there sometimes.
I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
[on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can’t wait until I’m off the phone with a customer?
Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm. [laughs] Okay.
Another time, Packer held this guy’s head in the toilet for like a minute.  Guy had no sense of humor about it.  Probably why he wasn’t hired.
[after Michael punches him in the arm] What did you hit me for?
Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. [giggles]  It was hysterical.
[to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones…
Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
That’s what I told him.  Thanks. [leaves]
Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?
Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  He’s so cute.  I like him
Old fashioned raid.  Sales on Accounting.  Yeah.  Follow my lead.
[as they throw accountants’ files and supplies around] Ahhhh!  Whoo hoo!  Come on, come on, come on, come on!  Sales rules!
Should we help ’em pick up their stuff?
No, no, no, no.  We don’t do that.  We don’t do that.
You’re gonna throw my things on the ground?
What happened in Michael’s office was wrong.  I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure]  But it… it was still wrong.
You know what?  I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office.  The only thing that makes any sense.
[on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller? [hangs up, dials again] Hello, Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and dials again] Hell , Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and begins to dial again] I’m totally gonna win us that box set.
Stop it. [Dwight hangs up] Stop.  It.  [Dwight beings to dial] Don’t.  Don’t.
I need to make a sales call.  Please?
[on phone, whispering] Am I the 107th caller?
[to Roy in Jim’s earshot] …back so soon.
We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe.
Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President’s Day or something.
Yeah, that’s right.  We could do a three-day weekend.  I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday.  Then I get a four-day weekend.
[to unseen co-worker] But it’s so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  ‘Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30.
[to Roy as Jim escapes into bathroom] Are you kidding?
We haven’t finished getting things in order from your last visit.
It’s just that we’re really swamped over here, Michael.
Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
[walking by with new carpet] What… What’s that?  Whatcha doing?
You know what, guys?  It’s none of your concern.  It was official business, so just…
Yeah, paper business.  Is this done?
Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour.  If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that. [snaps]
Somebody did something bad to Michael’s carpet. Maybe that’s all we need to know.
Are you kidding?  I thought it was you.
Really?  I thought you. [both laugh in Michael’s earshot]
This was no act of God.  A person did this.  A person who works in this office.  Maybe all of them.
You know what?  Today is not a good day for a sales contest.  We’re… we’re not… we’re not doin’ this today.
You wanna talk about fair?  Does anyone need to smell my old carpet?  You explain to me how that was fair, and I’ll explain to you how this is fair.  Plus I just… I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.
But you’re the one who picked today.
I am a victim of a hate crime.  Stanley knows what I’m talkin’ about.
Well I hated it!  A lot!  Okay, I… you know what?  If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we’d be done . [no one comes forward]  Very well.  Then you are all punished.
You’re all on a time out.  Just sit there quietly. [phone rings, Phyllis reaches to answer]  No.  NO!  [phone continues to ring]
Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It’s actually little awkward.
I don’t know.  Depends if you like a little junk in … [notices camera] Umm… She’s really cool.
Do you know if she’s looking for a long-term thing or if she’d be cool just hangin’ out?
[to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together… but don’t tell him that, okay?  Just tell him I’m, like, up for anything.  I mean, I’m not a slut, but who knows?
Sure.  He hired me.  How’s he doing?
My biggest fear is turning into him.
Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that.
[sighs]  I wasn’t talking literally, Creed.  Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy?  Why am I talking to you?
[meeting Ed Truck in parking lot] Ed?  Hi.  Thanks for meeting me.  Must be kinda neat comin’ back.
Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don’t wanna be up there right now.
So, what’s the problem with my pension?
Oh, no, no, no.  You’re good.  It was clerical.  You’re good.  Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
I didn’t get a good look at… it, but it smells horrible.
Yeah, somebody once did that in my office.
Well, that figures.  So how did you deal with people not liking you?
You can’t expect to be friends with everybody.
No.  They’ll always think of you as a boss first.
Not necessarily.  You can love a boss like you do a father.
Well, okay.  Different management styles.
Why can’t your workers be your workers, family be your family, your friends be your friends?
You just asked a girl out on the phone!
Hello, yes. I’m looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott.
Who is this?  How did you get this number?
Oh my God.  Packer.  Packster.  Whacky Pack.  How you doin’?
Hey, did you get that package I left for you?
Uh… no.  Did anybody see a package here today?  No.  How big was it?
Did you see a big package?  Where did you leave it?
Left it in the middle of your office.
Really?  Guys, did you see a big package in my office?
That was Packer!  Oh, you’re… you are dead.  You are dead, my friend!  That is hilar… Oh, God!  Of course it was you.
Oh.  [laughs and claps] Yeah, yeah!  Oh my God.  It was Packer!
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, Jim.  It’s Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael’s there and it’s horrible.  Anyway, I’m bored.  Come back!
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I can’t see Michael’s head.  It’s working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.
[voicemail message for Jim]  Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.
[voicemail message for Jim] I’ll transfer you.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Hold, please.  Dunder Mifflin, this is … okay, sorry.  Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would’ve happened, so thank you.
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, what’s that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I’m not messing this up, so I’ll see you tomorrow.
[voicemail message for Jim] Calling from my cell phone.  I don’t know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael’s carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy.  Everybody in the office.  We need to talk.
I think this whole disaster on Michael’s carpet happened for a good reason. Him sitting next to me is a huge gift. This girl I know would say that it was a gift from God, but I don’t know about all that.
Obviously, this was Kevin. This is his sense of humor exactly.
There are so many people with motives, even me. Almost everyone is a suspect. Whoever did this is a genius. [laughs]
Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing.
I went with my parents to the Shadowbrook Farm once. That was also really romantic. Oh, my God, I wish a boy would take me there. I would need a fun new top. You know what a great color is on me? Lavender, actually.
Just give me one second. I’m just gonna grab something to eat.
So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?
And then you just changed desks, right?
So, you just couldn’t take it anymore, huh?
Honestly, I don’t even hear her anymore. It’s like waves crashing against the beach.
[on the phone] Excellent, good, good. Well, our truck is going out first thing tomorrow morning. So…
…cases of typical format and coated white paper. Okay, thanks again so much. All right, bye-bye.
20 cartons of it’s coming, on it’s way.
Yes, yes. What yes? A sale or a lead or…
Would you say the sale that I made earlier was huge or…
[on the phone] Good. No, I completely understand, times are a little tight right now. If it’s alright with you though, I will just give you a call back next month. Great, thank you so much. Goodbye.
You call that a sales call? My God, what have they been teaching you?
You’re the one who trained me, Michael.
Yeah, well, did I teach you to roll over like a submissive dog?
Exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke.
Strike while the iron’s hot. A joke always works.
[on the phone] Yes, Howard Gruber, please.
[on the phone] If I was offensive in any way, I…
Tell him. Tell him that your supervisor is on the line.
[on the phone] …crazy ways. I’m going to pass you off to my supervisor. Hold on one second. [whispering] Howard Gruber. It’s Howard Gruber.
[on the phone] Hey Howard. Michael Scott here. Yeah, sorry about that. Dwight is an idiot. I know. No, he’s a little… Little dim. He’s the janitor’s brother, so…
[on the phone] Uh-huh? Yeah. Well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can’t even find their way to work? That is Dwight.
[on the phone] What can we do to help you out? You know what? I have a discount. Today and today only, on lightweight copier paper.
But that’s my sale. This is my sale, Michael!
[on the phone] Uh-huh, yes, I can do that. Absolutely! Perfect. Oh, I’m glad it timed out that way.
What Michael doesn’t understand is that when I worked in the fast food industry I was actually commended by management for the three “M”s. McService, McCompetence and McPunctuality.
[laughing] You gotta drink on that one. Too bad.
Hell yeah, yeah, yeah. Mo’fo, mo’fo.
Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you’ve got to drink.
Okay, look, I know what you’re gonna say. That I’m not standing up for myself. But you know what? It’s complicated and I really don’t appreciate all the badgering.
I really thought these people were my friends. My best friend since kindergarten, Elliot, that’s a friend. Best friend ever. I should call him. Wonder where he lives.
Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So…
Michael… I thought we agreed you wouldn’t be here.
Yeah… I… You know what… I… I… I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
Hold… Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today’s woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads…
No, just uh… you have come a long way, baby.  But I just… just want to keep it within reason.
You are not allowed in this session.
And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so…
Now you’re really not allowed in this session.
Well, I’m their boss, so I feel like…
[stands up] Anybody want any coffee or…
We’re fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.
Women in the workplace… yeah, translation “I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls.” Oh! Sorry. ‘Women of the workplace.’ About what? I don’t know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!
Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I… I… really apologize.
[in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They’re called… anyone?
Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they’re going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You’re a guy… too… sort of. Let’s do this!
[in the background] Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let’s just clap.
Let’s just clap. Ready? [clapping] Yeah! Yeah!
I don’t know what you’re doing here, Michael,
Just having a little ‘guys in the workplace’ thing.
Why can’t boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.
Oh, I think it’s going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven’t been there in months.
Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
I’m so sorry about that… um… so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?
So let’s meet the warehouse! Let’s get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?
My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There’s Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And… uh, she’s our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.
Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina… Roy…
Roy and Pam. It’s a Ram. It’s a Ram thing.
[talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he’ll try to beat you up.
I’ve got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
Why don’t we go around the table and all say something that we know we’re good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
Hi. I’m Meredith and I’m an alch… good at supplier relations.
I’m good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
I don’t know. I thought that I wasn’t going to be asked that…
I’ve seen some of your spreadsheets.
I don’t know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um… I mean we get along great. Fine. Um… I guess the person I have the most in common with is…
Jim… Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there’s a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.
No, it’s cool, because I know you’re a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so… you know. We’re cool, right?
You know, it’s great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She’s not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.
Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
Oh… well… okay… yeah, you know what? I don’t think… You.. You’re… My job sucks compared to this. I don’t think you’d like it up there.
Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?
Check this out! Look at that! Look at that [squeezes blow-up doll] bwup-bwa! [talks in girly voice] Hello! How are… [regular voice] Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.
In five years, I’d like to be… five years sober.
I’ll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
I want an SUV… with three rows of seats.
Well, I’ll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there’s any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
It’s dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
Hey, you’re going to, going to hurt yourself.
Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
Oh, oh, oh!  We’ll get somebody to clean that up.
We’re the ones that got to clean that up!
We ought to have this thing serviced.
So! Guy’s gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That’s going to happen, you know. We’re guys, so…
Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?
You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
Well… I have a job right now, so I can’t really take time off…
Well, it’s only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I’m sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.
Well… it’s just that the weekends aren’t good because, um…
There are always a million reasons not to do something.
Let’s start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?
So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
I hate shushing. You know, that’s the thing! What the… ok… what is our beef as human men.
You know that’s a good question, Hasselhoff. What bugs us?
OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That’s what guys do… and we love it.
All right. Let’s talk about clothing.
I’m excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.
I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they’re like “When are we going to go on a date-date?”
I hate that too! [general clapping and agreement]
Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like “Gas ain’t free!”
Yeah, on our salaries, man, what do they expect? You know to take us out every weekend? You know what I mean? We’re not millionaires.
No, you don’t. You don’t feel us. How can you? You know what?
You say we’re the same, but we get compensated very differently.
We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
You know this would not happen if we had a union.
Man, see… That’s what I’ve been sayin’, man. We need to do this finally.
You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union… of guys.
It’s more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker’s Union?
Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.
The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I’m sure that all of you have felt that before…
[knocks] This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna… Can I help you? Um… I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points…
Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.
Let’s… be… rational… here. What are the pros? What are the cons?
The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think… the… pros… are… here?
Don’t talk to me that way please. Just… they’re going to want to hear this from you.
You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
I mean I just don’t want to have to tell them something they’re not going to want to hear.
Ok. Come on Jan. After all we’ve been through…
I’m just saying we have something… Ok. Whatever.
You know what… we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a … many women ask to go over it. So… Fumble means…
Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait… that should mean better, that doesn’t make sense.
What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
I mean that’s a baseball term, right?
I don’t know what Michael was talking about. I don’t know.
[in the background] …and you went to Chili’s and he got to second base with you.
[in the background] Kelly, I don’t know what Michael’s talking about.
[in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term…
It’s a complete… well, actually it’s exactly what you’d expect, so… How are the girls?
Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
Um… but hey? Something kind of cool. There’s this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.
I think you should do it. That’s great!
Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?
You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that’s why you did that thing with Michael.
I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
Mmmm, I think we’re all okay with the balance we’ve struck.
At least you don’t have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
Okay. Let’s take five. I think we can all use five.
How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
Yuh, yuh, yes! I… I have essentially…
I have essentially. Yes. I’ve taken some…
Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
Roy’s right. There’s no guarantee it’s going to lead to anything anyway.
What? You have something you want to say?
You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
Oh, excuse me! I’m fine with my choices!
It’s impractical. I’m not going to try to get a house like that. Um… they don’t even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I’m never going to… .
I’m just going to put this over there.
Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza.  Poor people love pizza.  White people love pizza.  Black people love pizza.  Do black people like pizza?
Hey. Um… look guys, I’m sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch.
Generalized mumbling agreement. Yeah.
Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.
Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh… hold, please.
Oh! I don’t know, Pam. I paid $400 for this phone because I liked the ring.
And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I’m a little overwhelmed.
There’s a lot of choices. You got to help me here.
Which one of these is coolest? What do you think? [classical piano playing] [violin playing]
Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, “I am so lame.” Know which one I want? There’s one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It’s like… [imitating jackhammer] You know what I’m talking about?
Bushmaster’s hard to beat for long distance. It’s a great point.
Yeah. Shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 PSI, bon appetit!
Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit! [Darryl’s office window shatters] Sorry.
Would you sign here? [Phyllis gets up from desk and walks over.]
Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.
“Happy Valentine’s Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.”
Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. [Dwight holds up passport.] Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
I will stay here and run things on this end.
Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you’re in New York?
Well… It’s Valentine’s Day, and you guys, you know…
This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine’s Day. It’s New York. City of Love.
Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?
The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
Dude, I’m gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!
Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.
Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
[opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine’s Day. [pulls out bobble head] It’s me. I’m the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!
The meeting isn’t ’til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I’m gonna go get me a New York slice. [Michael walks toward Sbarro.]
Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
OH, that’s great. I’m really happy for [starts to walk away]
So I said, “Ryan, what took you so long?” And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I’m embarrassed.
Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
So nervous, but now — now I have a boyfriend.
[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.
Everybody takes the subway in New York. It’s fast, it’s efficient, gets you there on time. It’s a way to [turns and rushes back up stairs] Okay, there’s a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.
Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I’ve ever gotten.
Really? I wouldn’t know anything about that, but I’m glad you enjoyed it.
I didn’t get anything for Valentine’s Day.
Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.
[on phone] Nah that’s alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That’s fine. No, I didn’t even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
Woah, woah [Delivery man with oversized bear]
Michael Scott. [sticks out hand for handshake]
Josh Porter, high five. [They high five] Bam.
Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists]
You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?
Not much, they’re uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we’re just waiting for the presentations.
Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and… [awkward silence]
Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you… privately?
You can’t fire me, Dwight, just ’cause Michael’s not here.
No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room]
You need to get something for your girlfriend.
[same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn’t get anything for this particular person – who shall remain nameless – is that she’s not really the kind of person you’d think would be into Valentine’s Day. She’s kind of…
Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.
No, not like a ham. It’s about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.
Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]
What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?
Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said “You gotta fire four people,” and I was just like, “What?” Ya know?
No, I just ignored her. She’s the worse.
She ain’t my boss dude. I don’t work for that bitch.
Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that’s not. Cool it.
Maybe because she’s my girlfriend. [starts retracting statement] Was, or not my girlfriend. She’s… we hooked up and…
You know, months ago, just once, It’s, just stupid. Just forget it,
I don’t know what he’s thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
Take it slow. ‘Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need… [Ryan walks in]
[to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so… do you want to… do something tonight? Or…
[under breath] Oh, no, not while I’m here.
I mean, I know it’s Valentine’s Day, or whatever, but there’s totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So…
I can’t tonight. I have plans with my friends.
OK, That’s cool. I completely understand.
OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company’s financial strengths. All I’d like to do today is to…
Nervous, no I’m not nervous. Well, I guess I’d be lying if I didn’t say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I’m very nervous.
So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets.
What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.]
Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won’t. You know, not what this is about.
Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.
But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch’s performance, so do you have that information as well?
Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm… [hands over report]
[delivering plant to Oscar’s desk] Oscar.
It’s frustrating, because we’d be so perfect together.
You know what? Here’s the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It’d be great, but he isn’t.
Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
Well, he’s not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]
Yeah. Here’s the deal. I did not understand this was supposed to be a full on… like report or whatnot.
Um, I’m sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
I was under the impression this was, more of like… a meet and greet type deal.
So, does that mean you don’t have the numbers on your branch?
Craig, you realize that we’re trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
Well, the point is, is that doesn’t exactly bode well for your branch.
Oh man, you know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn’t get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too. [David looks at Jan, who glares at Michael.]
NO, NO I’m not, I’m not, I just… I just don’t know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we’re all gonna get fired.
Yeah, Michael – the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can’t believe that you told everybody and we didn’t even sleep together.
Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So…
Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It’s over. Do you understand?
Yes. I’m sorry. I will fix this. I’ll talk to him. I’ll talk to David.
I am serious. And don’t call me Shirley. Airplane.
Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.
Nothing, it’s just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you’d get me
Well, Valentine’s Day isn’t over. Let’s get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life.
You understand this is a very serious situation.
I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he’s not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins]
Well I don’t need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss…
I know. It was borderline at best and… And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I’m really sorry. It will never happen again.
Uh, that’s fine. Let’s just forget it.
Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine’s Day.
Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.]
Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.
Oh, no, it’s OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine’s Day.
Yeah, Happy Valentine’s Day. [Jan turns and then kisses Michael. Michael looks and sees camera, Jan turns and sees camera, too. Elevator door closes.]
Oy vey… schmear. [Points at Fiddler on the Roof playing at Minskoff Theatre and does a dance.]
Everybody, hello, can I have your attention, please? Since it’s Valentine’s Day, there’s something that I wanted to say. I love the women of this office. Pam, I love you.
Michael’s got a few tricks for Valentine’s Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he’s got a great line. “Me so thorny.”
I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course.
You have any big Valentine’s Day plans, Kev?
Not really, my fiance is out of town.
I’m not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn’t tell me.
That’s a lot of noodles. How much sodium do you think is in that cup? This place used to be full of hookers and porn shops and it’s not that way anymore. There’s an old building. That one hasn’t been torn down yet, but they will. They’ll get to it.
So, what are you doing for Valentine’s Day?
Probably go grab dinner with my girlfriend. He’s gonna be pulling his pud watching Skinemax. [points to Vance Refrigeration Worker #2]
Yes, sure. Mr. Scott, you can head to the conference room. The other managers are already there.
None of your business. I’m writing something.
Uh, yes, I’m in charge. You have to. Look it up.
Only if you tell me what you’re writing.
Forget it. I’ll do it. But you’re getting written up.
Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so… I guess there really is someone for everybody.
[phone ringing] Hi, this is Kevin. Stacy? Happy Valentine’s Day. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay. Yeah, I’ll be leaving here soon. Cool. I love you, too. Okay, ‘bye. Stacy’s back.
Hey Scott. Hey. Hey! Hey! Come here! Come here! I want to talk to you. Come here!
You know what? It was nice to see Devon again. To sort of get closure on that whole thing.
Could go either way. We don’t know what they are going to say.
Have to think it through. Because if they say no…
Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys… Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.
Ooh. They’re having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don’t have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?
Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs?
Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?
Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
Oh! I… uh… yeah. Um… I’ll uh show them to you later.
Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um… just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then… I just… I don’t want to offend… Angela… or someone.
Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
Well, it’s not really a big speech. You still coming right?
Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um… And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.
What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, “Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very…”
That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word ‘failure’.
That’s because you’re incapable of doing it because you don’t know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there’s no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
But I can teach you enough so that you don’t embarrass me or the company.
Okay, deal! I’ll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
Don’t. Don’t try and think of a question to humor me. Just… try not to be such an idiot.
Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
Mom, I’m sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my…
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
I’m going to take a trip. I’m going to get out of town for a while… and go someplace… not here.
Where do I want to go? Um… that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um…
I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I’m more productive. Maybe some people don’t like it as cold as I do, but I don’t care.
[stand up comic voice] But seriously, what’s the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
It’s a joke, Dwight. It’s not a Sex Ed class.
Yeah, you’re right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? [stand up comic voice] The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman… is boobs!
Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn’t matter what you say. It just matters that you’re saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.
Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
[generalized clapping and cheering] Congratulations.
You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.
No, no! It’s not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They’ll eat it up. They’re a great audience.
Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she…
Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
He’s kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don’t know why because it wasn’t funny… and it was just horrible.
All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let’s go. Let’s do it.
Pam! I’m public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
Yeah, the bride doesn’t really do… Have you ever been to a wedding?
Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.
So. Uh… I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I’m going yet. It’s kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
It’s like Club Med, but everything is naked.
I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
Oh ho hokay. You know what? That’s not a toast. You’re not standing up.
[mimes lifting a glass] To Amsterdam.
Uh, about a week. Er… .um… .maybe a month. I uh can’t…
Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me.
Like to say ‘Hi’ to my friends in China. [speaks in Chinese]
Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.
Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn’t working. Because um I’m not nervous in front of them. They’re my subordinates.
Uh, yes you are. I’m Assistant Regional Manager.
Dwight is not going to do a job. It’s sad. And they’re expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the ‘Lord of the Rings’ trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So… no… just leave me alone.
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
Oh please! You’re not taking any trip.
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you’ve got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
You’ve got to wave your arms and you’ve got to pound your fists. Many times. It’s supposed to emphasize your point.
Ok, I didn’t actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history’s famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own
It’s time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.
The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
Why’d you pick the V.A. for the reception?
Roy has a connection. It’s nicer than you think.
Of course. He’s one of my closest friends.
All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It’s a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We’re down here. Right.
[coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And… I think that I will go home and rest.
I’ve never, ever seen you take a sick day.
Well, I’ve seen you take enough for the both of us.
Next, I’d like to introduce the Dunder Mifflin Salesman of the Year, Dwight Schrute!
All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I’m going to cover for you. [shouts] All right!
Maybe we’ll use a DJ. That’s the one thing Roy’s in charge of for this wedding but all he’s managed to do is set a date.
But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I’ve always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
Actually, I don’t see myself ever getting married.
Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It’s obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just…
I’m very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. …And now the black guy from the ‘Police Academy’ movies. A robot. [makes robot sounds] Michael Winslow, anyone?
Car starting. [makes car sounds]  All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.
Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
I’ve got a time share in Key West that might be available.
You really think you’re going to go?
Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don’t know. If I were a betting man, I’d say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists]
[shouts] Together that we prevail! [cheering and clapping]
Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
I’m going. I’m a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that… um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
That’s awesome. Where are you staying?
I don’t know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but…
Yeah. And I’m really sorry about that, I just…
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?
It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
You would not believe what happened here.
Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like ‘I don’t have my ID, please give me one.’ And he was like ‘I can’t do that. I can’t serve you.’
She might have been. So she says ‘Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I’ll show you my ID.’ She hasn’t come back yet. She’s probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
Dwight gave a great speech. That’s the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?
My future is so bright, Jim. Jim, do you know how bright my future is? It’s so bright that… What? Do you know? Is there something I got to wear? Huh?
And what a lot of people don’t understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera.
That’s it? You’re going to end with “etcetera”? Okay, what’s this big organizational system that…
Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?
That would be suicide. Never, never talk specifics. Not in a speech. But the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.
My God, Dwight. The best way to learn is by watching. That’s why porn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Listen. Okay. Sit down, let me wow you. [clears throat] [shouting]
See, I have your attention now, don’t I? You’re scared, but now you’re ready to learn.
No, it did not. And that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor. We’ll find you a joke that not even you can ruin.
All right, listen up, please. Dwight has a joke.
[whispering to Angela] Stop it. [to the office] Two sailors walk into a bar…
Yeah, well, you know what? We need to… All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let’s go.
Who’s gonna start. How about Phyllis? You kick us off and then we’ll move around. Go ahead.
I would like to toast to the good fortune I’ve been having lately…
I, uh, I met a man and I’m totally in love, and that’s a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts…
Good. Good, good, good. That’s good. Now see, that’s not so hard, right? All right. Who’s next? Who are we going to… Ryan. Ryan’s next.
Why am I next? I thought we’d go in order?
Don’t be shy, shy boy. Don’t be shy. Get up there.
Well… A lot of you know that I’m in business school. And while I’m learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I’ll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.
Stop! Stop! Stop! That’s, you know what? The toast is really not supposed to be about anything. It’s certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so…
Ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time. Am I worried about that? Try scared to death.
As soon as they leave, well get Kelly and start.
Ghosts. Lots of ghosts in this old Radisson. There it is, Rosebud Room. Memories. Wow, this turnout is pathetic. I packed the house, you know.
Numismatic. Numismatic Collectors. Nope, wrong room.
Okay. They got sports medicine seminar, nope. Science fiction convention, nope.
Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I’m so in love with her.
No, no, no. It’s totally normal, ’cause she’s not a Cylon or anything. She’s just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.
Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don’t know. There we go.
Oh, I have more. [Holds up bags of candy]
Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w—
Oh, Michael. You can’t be nasty today. [whispering] ‘Cause of the… [points to ‘Welcome Daughters!’ sign]
Don’t you think you should say something?
Michael, I think that as the boss you should really—
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I’m Michael Scott, and… I… am in charge of this place… ahh, what’ll make you… understand… I am… like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.
Okay, I’m Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?
[under his breath] I work with a bunch of nerds.
This… is my file cabinet. Uhm… oh. This… is the partition… between my desk… and Angela’s.
Abby’s my fiancee Stacy’s daughter, I think she’ll have a good time. I just hope she doesn’t look on my computer. …Actually, I’d better go check.
Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa.
Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you’ve really grown up. You know what? Don’t mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the… frat boys away from her.
Yeah, middle school’s amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.
It’s not that children make me uncomfortable, it’s just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I’ve never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.
[while Jake is throwing things at Michael] They want how many spiral pads?
Um, fif–well, fifty… I… over ordered because they had a back order.
I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don’t have to pay for a sitter.
[to Sasha] Okay, tell them what you wanted to say.
No. Thanks. We’d… have to explain everything, it’s probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
Alright, I wasn’t expecting that. Let’s uh… let’s go draw.
Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don’t you just love kids, Angela?
I guess I wouldn’t mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I’m learning that fun for Kelly is… getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It’s actually pretty cool.
I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.
Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. …You don’t want to help me with some of my sales, do you? ‘Cause, I’m kind of swamped.
I’m Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd… let’s sell some paper.
Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I’m the conductor. [blows into whistle] But I’m sort of the conductor of the office here, right? [blows into whistle] You want to try?
Sure. [Sasha blows into whistle continously]
All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu…camonga! [Sasha and Michael laugh]
[shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
Really? ‘Cause she’s pretty strong, Dwight.
No, I don’t have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
Yeah, Meredith doesn’t have any either. It’s so lame here.
You call your mom Meredith? That’s very disrespectful.
You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
Sure, Mister Poop. [Jake walks away]
[quietly] … Schrute. [Jim and Abby snicker, Angela glares at Dwight]
I drink like, a hundred Ice Macchiatos a day, and practically nothing else.
There’s a really cool coffee place, Jitters, at the Steamtown Mall. Ever been there?
You’ve never been to Jitters? Ryan, you are
Come on! [Kelly glares through the door] You have an email address?
I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa]
Yeah. I mean, I’ve been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe … [Stanley gets up]
That little girl is a child! I don’t want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!
Boy have you lost your mind? ‘Cause I’ll help you find it! Whatcha lookin’ for, ain’t nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he’s not gonna help you if you don’t stop sniffing after my child!
Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
What the hell are you reading to them?
These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these—
Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don’t want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.
[standing up] Nazi was a fascist movement…
Don’t! Don’t! Don’t talk about Nazis in front of— you know what? They’re going to have nightmares, so why don’t you just shut it?
I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
[sighing] Why don’t you just leave? Okay?
Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?
Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. [cracks up]
You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].
This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? [pets shelf of paper] You know what that is? That’s paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?
So… you cut the paper and dye it and stuff.
No, we don’t actually cut the paper. That’s a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.
That’s not fair. [the rest of the kids agree]
Yes it is, well, w-w–you need someone in the middle to facilitate…
Wait, why doesn’t the saw mill just sell paper directly to people?
You are describing Office Depot, and they’re kind of running us out of business.
We have better service than they do!
…There’s Creed! Let’s take a look at what he’s doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of… something. Right?
Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? [begins untying shoe]
What are you doing? N–stop it! Stop it! Just–no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?
No no no, we’re not gonna see— we’re not gonna see the four toed… Creed, okay?
You know, there’s something interesting about me you might want to know. I … used to be … the star of a kids show.
I am totally serious. There was a show called ‘Fundle Bundle’ and I was the star.
I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?
Um, I’m already getting the pizzas from Bernetti’s, so…
Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
[to Abby] Alright, nowwww… what kind… of pizza do you like?
I don’t get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives… They’re adults, for God’s sake.
I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called ‘Fundle Bundle.’ Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?
[from TV] …Bundle, are you ready to come on in? [TV children cheer] Let’s have some fun!
That… is Miss Trudy. Can’t tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can… fast forward. And… I want you… to…
Is that a real fun shooting windmill?
Stop! Stop! Stop! [Ryan resumes the tape] Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.
Checkin’ in with Chet. Doppler’s up.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don’t miss it.
Well what’s your favorite subject at school?
Ree-cesss. So tell me, what do you want to be when you grow up?
I want to be married and have a hundred kids so I can have a hundred friends, and no one can say no to being my friend.
[jaw drops, awkward pause] Uh, ah… oh, okay! Well uh, nice talking with you, Michael. Uh, back to you Miss Trudy!
Hi everyone, it’s one of my favorite times of the day.
So you didn’t get to be what you wanted to be.
…I guess not… you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza… and I’m going to go do my work. Bye.
He’s not coming out. He won’t pick up the phone.
Can’t believe his mom dressed him like that, that’s the real tragedy.
[wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on!
So, Melissa… I met your mom a couple times. She’s
That woman is not my mother. That is my step-mother.
Mister Poop, I have to tell you something.
Uh, okay. But first, that’s not my name.
Well at least I’m not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So…
I think these belong to you. [puts toys down on desk]
Oh, that’s okay, she can keep those.
Believe me, she has enough toys… she doesn’t need your watch.
You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
Well, sure, playing the field is great, don’t get me wrong, but there’s more to life than notches just on my bedpost.
Tell me something honestly, do you… think… that it is too late for me to have kids?
Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.
If you really want to have kids, I— I guess you could somehow… foster parent, or something.
Thanks, that’s, no, that… that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I…
It’s not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?
Okay. Um… here it is. Don’t put your fingers in there. [shreds paper] Cool huh?
Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.
Do you want to come over for dinner tonight?
Ohh, man, I would love to! I can’t tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods]
What’re you doing? You never have plans.
Thanks, Kev. Uhm… I’m actually going on a date.
Hey, uh, no, please? You can’t leave yet. There’s still one more thing we need to do.
[singing] You… who are on the road… must have a code… that you can live by… [Dwight joins in] and so… become yourself… because the past… is just a goodbye… and teach… your children well…
Why does he own a guitar if he doesn’t know how to play?
I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves]
[singing] …did slowly go by… and feed… them on your dreams…
My theory is that… [Jim signals he’s leaving, waves bye to Pam]
[singing] …The one they picked… the one you’ll know by… don’t you ever ask them why… if I told you would cry… you never look at them and sigh… and know they love you…
And they do, your parents, love you very much.
Okay. I think five plain and one veggie should be fine.
Fine. The first lesson we’ll teach children will be about obesity.
I’m pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby’s daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she’s the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don’t know how cool she thinks I am.
Learn why Daddy’s so cranky when he comes home from work.
I brought my daughter Melissa in. That girl is very spoiled. That child has no idea what I have to deal with so she can have her little cell phone and spend all my money at that Steamtown Mall.
[whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I’m the head accountant today?
Yeah, but can I say that I’m it, just for today?
I can’t set that kind of precedent. She’s a bright girl. She’d see right through that.
Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let’s see.
I got some muscles. You wanna see the muscles? Bam! Look at that.
Didn’t do background checks of the warehouse guys. [exclaims] Well, I’m sure it’ll be fine.
Can I have a quarter? I promise I’ll pay you back.
Can I have a dollar? Then I can buy chips and a drink.
Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.
Just give me two seconds, I’ll be done.
Dude, seriously, just give me two seconds, I’ll be done.
…get you, I’m gonna get you! Come back here for more! [squealing]
What the… [pulls a pencil eraser out of his mug, after a drink]
Yeah, I wanna be an artist when I grow up.
Okay. It’s been a little more tiring than I thought.
Yeah, it doesn’t help that Stanley’s daughter’s such a slut.
Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official.
Oh, I hate to break it to you, Abby. The certificate’s a fake. Okay? It’s not real. Where’s the certification number, Halpert?
Actually, I have the certification number right here.
“A7557962.” Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.
Don’t worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are… the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
You know what? That’s a nice attitude, Ryan, I’m just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
Didn’t you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?
No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don’t know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a
Thank you very much. It is from Italy. [checks jacket] Actually— no, Bulgaria.
Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  They’ve been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the…
Don’t! Nope! Please, don’t want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
Let’s get the party started. [Begins ‘raising the roof’]
Let’s get the party started.  Not the way I taught you! [Michael joins in]
When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
One thirty. [Pam yawns] I’m sorry, are we boring you?
Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam]
Yes, but he doesn’t want to know when, or whom.
I’m… returning your call, you said it was urgent.
It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
Really? ‘Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. [Jan hangs up]
[to Ryan, sitting across from Michael] …You can take a five, if you want.
Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!
Man, I’m so sorry. When do you find out?
They said this afternoon. They’re waiting on a second opinion.
Oh, no! I was watching Grey’s Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and
I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister’s.
Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut [closes box].
You don’t know it’s going to be okay. Don’t give him false hope. …It’s probably nothing, though.
[eating donuts while Dwight plays the recorder] Stop it. Stop! What is that?
It’s ‘For the Longest Time,’ by William Joel. It’s you favorite song.
Yeah, well, it’s on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
You’re making it worse. I bet Luke Perry’s friends don’t treat him like this [points to James Dean poster].
If I knew I had a week to live, I would… probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And… I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. …It would be a pretty busy week.
Uh, that’s a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back… order… [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here!
Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother’s vaginal canal, so… huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
So come help me celebrate Michael’s birth moment. Kevin!
Ohh, no, no, no! I can’t… Ryan, come on. Let’s do this.
…I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
Maybe, but… we’re gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and…
On three, we’re going to hoist away! Ready?
One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling]
Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it… please.
Uh, we don’t make an eight foot sub. This is eight one foot subs.
[pulls out wallet] Thirty nine… sixty.
Why tip someone for a job I’m capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because… I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
Birthday party subs! My gift to you.
Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.
Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.
So. We got Kev some stuff. Um… a party pack of M&M’s, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won’t get that back.
Which we realize sounds crass, but, it… is his favorite number.
Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer].
[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?
Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.
What are— it’s… the party planning committee.
[whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can’t risk anything.
What about that meeting… later… to discuss finances?
Yes… [whispering] but don’t expect any cookie.
[whispering] But what if i’m hungry?
[puts fabric softener into cart] …What?
[singing] Happy birthday dear Michael, [Michael joins in, Kevin’s phone rings] Happy birthday… [everyone but Dwight stops] …tooo youuuu.
No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.
Uhhh… blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm… [blows out the candles]
Okay. Well, when she comes back we’ll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven’t had a hug all day.
No one cares about your birthday. Kevin’s waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
… Aww, that… sucks, great. … Wow, that’s good timing. That’s… that’s, sorry, that’s terrible. Terrible news. That’s terrible… terrible news for both of us [takes cake into office and slams the door].
[checking watch] We should probably head back.
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
[over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.
[loudspeaker] Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you…
Ma’am? Please don’t touch that. That is not a toy.
[to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee’s plan? Our health plan is s… just… it’s terrible.
There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
Yeah, but it’s not brain cancer. And it shouldn’t stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
I don’t really think people are in the laughing mood.
Why are you here? I didn’t even invite you to my birthday party.
[mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn’t speak for everybody and I am your boss, I… think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.
If I go home now, I’ll just drive myself crazy.
Well, you’re pretty much driving everyone else here crazy… crazy with worry.
Where have you been? And don’t say the bathroom, ’cause I kicked in all the stalls.
Well that’s an invasion of privacy, so, I’m going to tell Michael.
Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we’re going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
Is this trip related in any way to your… birthday?
[sees ‘Happy Birthday Michael Scott!’ poster at skating rink] That should not be there.
No, it’s alright. It’s already up. Just leave it. Where’s Kevin? Come on! Let’s get our skate on!
Don’t be scared! You’re good! You’re good!
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]
Yeah, I’ve been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you’re on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.
Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin… um, it’s pretty scary. And I’m thinking that uh, next time you’re in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or…
Uhh, no, I… don’t just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.
Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?
Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin’ now!
Push. Good! That’s great. You got it. [Kevin’s phone rings] Excuse me.
Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.
Oh… God… [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We’re gonna beat this, okay? We’re gonna… come here [hugs Kevin].
Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would… be… chaos.
Okay, who’s this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
Thank you… Dwight. That’s great. Thanks.
Oh! You didn’t need to do that. …Nightswept. This is… really amazing. Thank you. I love it.
Michael’s birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don’t know… It was a good day.
That’s not how I taught you, right? [singing] My hump, my hump, my lovely lady lump Check it out [Dwight imitating drumbeat]
Good. You know, Ryan, you didn’t have to get me a present.
On my 20th birthday, my supposed best friend, Sam Ambrose, ditched me for his twin sister’s Sweet Sixteen party. And that was my worst birthday. Until today.
Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away]
To think that a man’s skin could turn on him. It’s brilliant, ’cause you’d never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all.
Oh, good. Okay. Don’t tell me, tell them.
[turns to camera] “The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.”
Oh, my God. That’s a piece of cake. That’s a piece of cake. Oh, 2%. Jeez, that’s good.
[looking at camera] “There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.”
Out of, like, 18 billion Americans, so, no worry.
“For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and…”
Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, “I have cancer.”
“The skin is the largest organ of the body.”
Untrue. The heart is bigger than the skin. If you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.
I’m not afraid of dying. I know where I’m going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony.
So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight
Let’s go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions.  But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff’s deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven’t.
[mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
[laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he’ll look up at me from his desk and he’ll just be someone else. Like he’ll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that’s supposed to be Phyllis.  I can’t do it as good as he can.
And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I’m so small and all I’d eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said “Is it okay if I sip it?” and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I’m going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night?
I didn’t know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
Okay, I’m gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys.
Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you’re totally harshing the office mellow.
I can’t stop this investigation. It is my job.
…to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
I wasn’t attempting to compliment you.
…because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have…
…and I am very proud of being a narc.
Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?
I don’t think Michael’s ever done drugs. I don’t know if anyone has ever offered him any.
Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother’s funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He’s a potential drug mule.
Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
Do you think it’s possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
I don’t want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her]
[grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.
That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.
I’m just saying that you can’t be sure that is wasn’t you.
That’s ridiculous, of course it wasn’t me.
Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don’t remember.
Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
Knock it off, okay, I’m interviewing you.
No! You said that I’d be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I’d love to hear it.
Oh, um…[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC’ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]
Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]
Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]
I know you’re innocent, but I can’t look like I’m treating you any differently.
Where were you yesterday after work?
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who’s he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin?
Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who’s in trouble?
Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone’s urine.
Waa… what? What are you talking about?
Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.
Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
No you cannot. It has to be official, and it
Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great.
Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
I don’t take any prescription drugs.
We’re having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]
It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
No, I don’t. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.
Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?
Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael.
No it’s not. It’s a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.
Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby’s urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.
I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.
Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I’m going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.
I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
The point I’m trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don’t quite hate ’em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.
You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
Okay, well Dwight just know that I’ve been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn’t planning on going to the bathroom and I don’t even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.
Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff’s deputy.
So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
Yes in a cup, we’re not animals, Dwight.
Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
Don’t think of it that way. It’s like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there’s no controlling it. It just… goes
A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
No, just look. Look. Just… just fill up the cup.
Do you want to give Michael your urine?
I want him to have all the urine he needs.
You’re not going to get my permission on this.
I know that. Don’t you think I know that?
Yeah, we do testing all over the country.
You want to work at the urinalysis lab?
Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.
It’s a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
How much time do you have left on your break?
Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I’ve decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
That’s fantastic because I’ve always felt that the security here sucked .
Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary voluntary corporal in charge of assisting all activities security.
Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun?
Okay, I’ll have to bring in my bow staff.
I need to go over some details with you.
First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
I’m not only hoping to find the culprit who committed this heinous crime, I am praying to find this heinous culprit. And I will pray to Thor himself, if that’s what it takes.
Michael’s behavior is erratic and unpredictable, but I don’t think he’s doing drugs. Maybe he should. Take the edge off. Uh, not at work, of course.
People use marijuana to escape. Jim does not have a girlfriend. His sales are nothing to brag about. And he does not belong to any organized clubs. If that were my life, I’d do drugs.
He asked if you’ve been acting withdrawn lately.
Your turn, Stanley. [Stanley just takes a drink from his mug] Angela, you’re up.
I won’t. It’s just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that?
I know that I shouldn’t have done it. But I was in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy.
And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.
Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold.
Kelly Kapour. Say your prayers. Let’s go. Conference room, pronto. Come on, step it up.
Drugs are everywhere in our society. They are omniscient. If you look at the amount of pot that was smoked in the United States last year, that would reach the moon.
No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or…
I have some hemp ropes at my house, they’re really strong…
Shut… Shut it. No. Just… Just focus on the facts. Cocaine. They use cocaine.
One thing that you need to remember is that there’s no way of knowing who’s a user, who’s an abuser, because we don’t know. It could be anybody. Your instinct is to say it’s somebody-like Stanley or Oscar…
[on the phone] Michael, I’m gonna get going. I really don’t think I need to be in this meeting.
Okay, well, I really think that… [dial tone beeping]
Has she been on the phone the whole time?
Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers’ quarrel.
Okay, let’s get personal for a second, shall we?
The scary thing is, it could have been any one of these people. They all had a motive. To get high.
You have to relax your muscles around the bladder.
I don’t… Let’s just not talk about it, okay?
[reading from Michael’s flier] “Drugs:
You know, sometimes I wish we just didn’t have a conference room. [Kelly laughs] You know? He couldn’t do that.
But then we wouldn’t have any meetings.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don’t have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay.
I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner’s high, which is why now I swim.
Why would I be worried? I’m not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free.
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Um, hold, please. [to Jim] There’s a Brenda on the phone for you. [to Brenda] Just one second, I’ll transfer.
[telephone ringing] [shows note to camera “It’s OK. She’ll call back!”]
He’ll be up. Okay, sure. I’ll get someone down.
Sheriff Pierce? I’m turning in my badge.
No. No, you didn’t. we didn’t give you this.
No, I mean at the gift shop. Also, I can’t wear this anymore.
You were never supposed to wear this in the first place, Dwight. Come on now, seriously, you got me concerned here a little bit.
Oh, don’t worry. I never abused my power. I only tried to help the Sheriff’s Department in any way I could.
Right, well… Why don’t you give me a couple examples of ways that you’ve helped us out?
Oh, God, there are so many. Roadside assistance, breaking up unruly parties, surveillance…
Mace! You… You’ve been carrying around weapons-grade Mace?
[tosses the butt of a joint in parking lot] We should get a pizza.
‘Cause I’m in a band. We really rock.
Yeah, I mean it’s inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I’m fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but …  it’s my wedding. And I don’t want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam’s. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We’re doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.
Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
Um…  let’s um, let’s keep our clothes.
It’s like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he’d freak out! He’d freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels… it’s… and I’m supposed to work there. I’m supposed…
[walking into the Conference room] What’s the dealio?
Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer’s back there today.
It’s just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
So what, you’re having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
Here’s how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.
These things just have a way of working themselves out.
It’s like if you write someone a letter, when you’re really angry… they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So…
That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
Yeah, well… that’s not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part… assuming we don’t get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
[holding up a binder] A mediator’s tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You… you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is – win/win or whatever?
Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
[in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using “I” emotion language and no judging or “you” statements.
I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let’s see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.
Okay… well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
[snaps a photo of Creed, then Creed turns to the side for a profile shot] No, you’re all good.
Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn’t have your zip code.
It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It’s not my taste.
Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]
You can’t do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
[sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It’s all Dwight’s.
Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I’m sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
Ohh… God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder]
Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
Whoa.. wha… wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
[notices Angela’s intense concern] Um… let’s move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let’s do it! And [looks through the file]… okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
Uh… [reading]”Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn’t she do that at home?” [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don’t we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I’ve been really nice to her… and I haven’t told anyone. And what the hell?!
Here is a Kelly complaint: “Ryan never returns my calls.” Ugh, join the club.
My voicemail’s really spotty… sometimes…
I didn’t file a complaint. I was just talking.
To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
Fine, I’ll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know.
[crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin’ progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?
And I didn’t tell anyone because I’m not really sure how I feel about it.
That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
Well, I’m not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
[gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
[still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
I didn’t do it! [Michael and Stanley continue to talk off camera, but it’s inaudible]
I find that hard to believe… considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
Someone complained that the men’s room is “whites only”. Stanley, you know that’s not true.
Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]
Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela’s giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
And… also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
[sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again]
I can’t believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.
Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she’s just trying to be friends.
[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?
I don’t know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
You mean your thoughts and feelings?
I know you keep saying it’s your space, even though there’s no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
[whispering to Angela] I don’t like you.
OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?
I know exactly what he’s talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
Hey… you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
Well, it saves time, you know. ‘Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
[to Dwight, who is sitting in front of the camera] Smile.
I never smile if I can help it. Showing one’s teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
This came out really well. [picks up Dwight’s I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.
This is humongous. I am not a security threat…
And my middle name is ‘Kurt’, not ‘Fart’.
I have another complaint for Jim’s permanent file.
Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays… [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]
Ah… agh… dgh… Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
No! You calm down! Who’s side is Toby on? Who’s side are you on?
Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out]
Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
[picks up Dwight’s I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you’re a security threat?
Okay… you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn’t work, everybody would still be in the cage.
Okay, so Dwight, in your own words – [reads from complaint paper] “Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.” [flips to another paper] “Everyone has called me ‘Dwayne’ all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.”
[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just… took ’em all out.
[reading] “Every time I typed my name, it said ‘Diapers’.”
Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don’t sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
“By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.”
Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that’s how I spent my entire day that day.
The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I’ve never had one. They sound awful.
Hey, there’s like, 300 more of these. Let’s get to them later.
So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Maybe, I haven’t decided yet. Let’s get to work.
Okay. Oh… actually, tomorrow’s not good. How about later in the week?
Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you’re here?
I can’t. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.
Well… that’s… what, a computer camera, right?
Ugh… All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.
Come on, let’s go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar… andale! Let’s go.
One, two, three… smile. [camera flashes, but no one smiles] Try to smile.
We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
Alright, I’m just gonna take it on three…  whether you smile or not. One, two, three. [camera flashes]
Good, let’s check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We’ll take one more.
Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
[off camera] You just press the button.
I’m the one who complained about you.
I… I didn’t know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.
[off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.
And I took it right back. It was like…
[off camera] Let’s pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay… we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]
It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
[flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn’t say three, did I?
But, I’m sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can’t outrun your problems.
And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here’s the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
[elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?
Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?
Dwight, I really think someone’s probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.
A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It’s not a prank.
Damn it, people! Someone must have seen something! [Jim’s cell phone beeping] Oh, you people are useless. Jesus.
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it’s the Sheriff. He said that it’s really important. It’s regarding your desk. I’ll transfer.
Oh, no, no, don’t! I can’t… [groans] [telephone ringing]
Just cut through it, man, it’s no big deal.
This is why I’m a Volunteer Sheriff’s Deputy and you’re not.
That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it’s a murder.
[exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight’s phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff’s Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What’s your 20?
Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can’t always be like The Apprentice.
On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.
[Dwight slurping] Okay, here we go. One, two…
He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.
I’m the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.
That’s not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?
Would you seriously want your wedding photos to look like that?
I gave her a higher clearance than you.
I’d tell you, but then I’d have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]
Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed]
You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I’m not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]
Wow! I never thought Dwight would go postal. It’s always the person you least expect and I always thought Dwight would go postal.
Come on, Dwight, I think it’s actually healthy to get it off your chest.
I’m done talking. I am a Schrute. We don’t back down.
You’re arrogant and pompous, and I don’t like you.
“Cage Match”? I don’t know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you’re asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no.
Excuse me, sir! Dwight Schrute, is that your real name?
Thank you. [elevator door closes] No, come on… God!
I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
So, what’s the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That’s lame.
Come on, it’ll be fun, and besides, I’m a roulette expert.
Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
I can always kind of win at roulette.
[laughs] You can’t be serious. Are you serious?
Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
[scoffs] That’s ridiculous. You know what? Uh… Why don’t you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
Okay, I’ll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]
I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It’s more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
[on phone] Yeah, but… Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
You know that I’m very serious here.
Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we’re having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
I thought that you were their fearless leader.
I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
You know, it’d be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we’ve remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.
Okay, everybody. Tonight’s event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.
Well, they need our money. They don’t have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
It’d be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
Well, then, they need our money more than ever.
You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
There’s a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I’ll probably give the money to them.
Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is
We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don’t we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We’re gonna…
I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he’s concentrating more on the bachelor party now.
I’m pretty happy these days. I’m getting married soon and I’m getting along with everybody at work.
Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know… I have no future here.
I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
It’s Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
Actually, it’s owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, “Fleece it out.” “Going mach five.” “Dinkin’ flicka.” You know, things us Negroes say.
Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture]
Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
Oh, wait. That’s Kevin. On the drums.
Oh, my God, that’s Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he’s the drummer and the singer.
We really don’t do a lot of weddings. We actually don’t play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam’s wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Yeah, you haven’t seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I’m gonna call the label, we’re gonna…
No, Pam, you’re gonna lose him to another wedding.
Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
[phone rings] Michael, Carol Stills for you.
Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it
Sometimes I don’t put Michael through until he’s already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
I’m great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It’s okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.
Oh, good, I’m glad. Can I drop it over later?
Actually, I’m sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.
Yeah, it’ll be good. You know what? Why don’t you come by? Bring the papers, I’ll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
Yeah. It’ll be fun. What do you…[phone rings] What do you…
Oh, I’m sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume?
It’s still me. Uh, Jan, here’s Michael.
You know, I… I thought about it and you are right.
I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just…
I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn’t be a problem.
Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
[People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God!
Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.
Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
I’m Michael’s wingman. I’ve got his back. Two dates. He’s got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, “We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.”
Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
Oh, I steal things all the time. It’s just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I’ve taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things.
I’m gonna get a drink. Do you need anything?
Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
She was never my nurse. I met her at Chili’s. She was my waitress.
Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
[Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
Okay, the game is No-Limit Texas Hold’em. Good luck, everybody. That’s at least four red chips to you, sir.
All-in. [Other players fold their hands]
Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I’m not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?
Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn’t that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don’t be stupid. Just take it back.
No, I’m sorry. He can’t, sir. He’s gone all-in.
You really screwed that up. [Michael leaves]
I don’t really play cards, but I’m not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.
I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.
[coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.
It’s the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren’t involved, I would always be winning. [Sees Jan] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look, okay, I think we’re all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
What are you… Just… Wait, what’re you talking about?
After you said you weren’t coming, I invited Carol to come and I don’t think that I did anything wrong.
No. No, you didn’t. Hi, I’m Jan. I’m Michael’s boss.
Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]
Dwight, let’s keep it going. Let’s keep it going. Let’s go.
Mhmm, And I’m gonna take you all-in.
Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen.
Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That’s a long drive.
Well, it’s part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So… Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been…
Oh, well, actually, I guess this would be our first date. I guess.
Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.
One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
So, that’s still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
The point is four. Shooter, roll it. Four!
Four! [Holds dice in front of Carol] Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. [Holds dice in front of Jan] All right, here we go!
Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson?
Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah… I’m pretty good at poker.
Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn’t matter, it’s just fun to play.
Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.
Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding?
Whatever. I’m in charge of the music.
Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
It was very late, Jim. Very… Very late and… Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
Excuse me. Big moment. The evening’s chip leader and winner of this beautiful mini-refrigerator courtesy of Vance Refrigeration, Creed Bratton, Dunder Mifflin!
Thanks. I never owned a refrigerator.
Okay. Hey, don’t try to lose too much money, all right?
If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?
Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.
Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
About when you want to give me more of your money?
Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I’m feeling kind of good tonight.
I’m really sorry if that’s weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just…
What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
Come on. I don’t wanna do that. I wanna be
I can’t. I’m really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It’s probably my fault.
Not your fault. I’m sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
And you guys have a good time together.
[On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn’t know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don’t know, mom, he’s my best friend.  Yeah, he’s great.  Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim… [They kiss]
Everybody, in the conference room now, please. Thank you. Time is money.
I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.
Good. Yes, that will work. All right. Now I need a plural noun. [All groaning]
Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he’s making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I’d like to choose a different adjective.
No, no, no. No, no, not until you give me an adjective.
No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey’s good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.
Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn’t so hard. All right, here we go. “Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.”
“One of them was named Michael Scott, and he was an…” Oh, damn it. Okay. Okay, okay, we’re… Okay, we’re starting over.
My charity is the Farm Defense Fund. It’s one of the best organizations that fights infestation of the beet armyworm.
My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff’s Department, because Dwight’s a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him.
I don’t believe that Jim moved that coat rack. But if he did, he has an obligation to use his gift wisely. With great power comes great responsibility. They could do a cross-section of his brain to find out more. But I don’t think it’s true, though.
Look, if anything goes missing, we will reimburse.
Yeah. Can Dunder Mifflin afford that?
Dang! Paper making paper, I.e. money.
Paper money. [clears throat] Yeah. The company’s doing fine.
Mike, we’re not shipping as much as we did last year.
Hey. Okay. You know what? Don’t even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don’t think about it.
It is extremely stressful, planning a wedding by yourself. It’s like a job. I mean, it’s fun, but it kind of becomes like work. I’ve already planned it all out in my head. But it’s just in my head.
Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I’ve had sex with.
[after “the kiss”] You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that.
No… [Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim—
Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] …Ok.
[sobbing] Jim is gone.  He’s gone.  I miss him so much.  Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  [serious]
No!  That is the fun of this place.  I call everybody “faggie”. Why would anybody find that offensive?
OK I think Oscar would just like if you used “lame” or something like that.
Apparently you called Oscar “faggie” for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.
It wasn’t just an action movie, it was Die Hard!
All right Michael, but Oscar’s really gay.
No, I mean he’s attracted to other men.
OK, a little too far, crossed the line.
OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual.  Yeah, he told me this morning.  And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion.
I would have never called him that if I knew.  You don’t… You don’t call retarded people “retards”.  It’s bad taste.  You call your friends “retards” when they’re acting retarded.  And I consider Oscar a friend.
Listen man, I am so sorry.  I had no idea.
That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let’s do that.
[in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much.
No, I’m not gay.  And I don’t understand why anyone would think, that I’m gay… if… [sighs] Uh… yeah I’m gay.
I can’t say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that’s pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can’t beat that view… right?
Hey, Big Tuna!  You’re single right?
She’s pretty hot huh? [Jim nods]  She’s completely crazy.  Steer clear Big Tuna.  Head for open waters.
I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  …I don’t think any of them actually know my real name.
So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch.  And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber.  Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them.
Jim’s nice enough.  I dont… I don’t know how well he’s fitting in here. He’s always looking at the camera like this.  [makes classic “Jim”-camera face] What is that?
Can you tell who’s gay and who’s not?
Well, he’s not dressed in women’s clothes, so…
[deep sigh] There could be others…  I need to know.  I don’t want to offend anybody else.
You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
Yeah, I’m sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
Hey, what about Angela?   She’s hard and severe.  She could be a gay woman.
I don’t know, I can imagine her with another woman, can’t you?
Do some research.  Find out if there’s a way to tell by just looking at them.
Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
Yeah probably.  He didn’t tell the truth a lot.
[sighs] Let’s call him and get the website.
Damn.  [thinks]  I’ll try Brookstone.
After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest.  I’ve been working out and um, you know, I’m not gonna take her for granted.  I gotta win her back.
I got them a toaster.  They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me.  I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster.  So now my house has got two toasters.
That is so cool that you’re gay.  I totally underestimated you.
Yes I’m super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace… and I want to throw up.  It’s terribly loud.  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on.  He’s so talented.
OK.  Who put my calculator in Jello?  Good one.  But uh, seriously, guys who did this?  Seriously guys, who did this?  I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I’m gonna lose MY FRICKIN’ MIND!
You know, it’s amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.
I watch the L Word.  I watch, Queer as F***, so…
OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?
Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.
Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade?  It’s not like gay… shame festival.
All right, now Oscar’s feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that’s your fault.
I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!  Is that what this is about?
[laughs] Well, I’m not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!
Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?
The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.
Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
Trick question!  Cause you can’t always tell, so… how would I know.  Is that the right answer?
Michael, Dwight’s looking at gay pornography on his computer.
Uh, Michael knows Pam.  He asked me to do this just for him.  He has his own reasons.
[yelling] All right, everybody in the conference room!  I don’t care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight!  JUST GET IN HERE!  RIGHT NOW!
Did you know that gay used to mean happy?  When I was growing up it meant lame.  And now it means a man, who makes love… to other men.
Yes I’m gay.  And I didn’t plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?
Who should be the judges and juries of our society?
I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
That’s great.  Congratulations Phyllis.  That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!  [laughs] See?  Everybody has a chance!
But still, Phyllis, in college?  Did you ever experiment with other women?  A lot of women do!
No, you knew me in high school.  Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
[laughing] Right!  [serious] And I take that as a compliment.
Well with your ties and your matching socks and —
Well, I just like to look good OK, so —
No, I am just coming out myself.  I am coming out hetero!
I think the problem with this office is that
No no no.  The only signal that I am sending is:
Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.  I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just… I would be waving that rainbow flag.
I don’t think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
…and I just don’t care who sees it, doesn’t bother me!
No, NO!  I don’t want to touch you, ever consider that?  You’re ignorant, and insulting, and small!
Michael… I’m sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]
[sobbing] I’m sorry I called you faggie.  You’re not faggie.  You’re a a good guy.
Michael appears to be gay too.  And yet he is my friend.  I guess I do have a gay friend.
[Dwight gets up to kiss Oscar]  Oh come on!  Dwight!  Come on, man!
I am glad that today spurred social change.  That’s part of my job as regional manager.  But you know what?  Even if it didn’t, at least we put this matter to bed.  …that’s what she said.  Or he said.
Oh, there’s Gill.  Oscar’s roommate.  I wonder if he knows?
I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won’t sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
[reading the note with the gay-dar]  “Hope this helps.  -Jim”  Nice!
[Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar’s body]  What are you doing?!
Shhh.  Don’t be scared.  [gay-dar beeps over Oscar’s belt buckle, Dwight smiles] It works.  [gay-dar goes off next to Dwight’s belt buckle]  …oh no.
[on speakerphone] Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?
I will do my job to the best of my abilities.
[under breath] Heaven help us. [aloud] Specifically.
Specifically, Jan, I will make at least ten phone calls to clients.
Yes, I have to begin every day by letting Jan know what I intend to accomplish, and then I have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what I
[on speakerphone] Are you on the toilet, Michael?
Well, I know sometimes you are and… that you wouldn’t tell me, so I’m just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you’re finished.
Okay. [Jan hangs up. Toby opens the office door.]
I’m… painting my new apartment tonight.
Aw. Well, hang in there, okay?  You know what? You should get one of this big body pillows. That way you wouldn’t miss you-know-who so much.
What do I think? I think everybody should stay out of everybody’s personal business!
Why are all the best-looking single men always gay?
Hey, Big Tuna. You ever Google Google? What do you think would happen?
I didn’t mean you should do it. You were supposed to ponder it. It’s… You removed the fun. Thanks a lot, Big Tuna.
Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.
Maybe you should wait before you adopt.
Roy’s sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.
Um… find out if there’s a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?
You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.
I don’t even know if I’ll want a baby in eight months.
You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven’t had a baby, and you haven’t had a baby…
All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
Don’t be mad, it is a business trip.
But I don’t understand. It’s for managers.
Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.
I know! It… I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?
Don’t “Monkey” me! You can’t wait to get out of here, A. R. M.
In the Martin family, we like to say, “Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.” That’s code for “check out the slut.” What is… why are there flies in here?
Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?
Yes, I have a date. He’s a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I’m kind of nervous. I haven’t been on a first date in nine years… probably shouldn’t broadcast that.
Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.
My neighbor Alan. They’re going on a date tonight.
Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.
There’s my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train?
That was for per diem, for Philadelphia.
That town smells like cheese steaks.
Andrea’s the office bitch. You’ll get used to her. [introducing himself] Creed.
Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
Good to see you. There he is! There’s the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product… the progidal… my son returns.
I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It’s like the firemen. You don’t leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut.
Yeah! Wow, I didn’t expect that. It’s good to see you too!
Oh, hey, how’s it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?
You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.
If I weren’t engaged, I would so hit that.
So what kind of commissions you get up there?
Oh, Dwight. I’ve missed you so much.
Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman.
And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I’m going to look for a place for you at Stamford.
Great, let’s dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.
Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.
The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I’m still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.
Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.
And they’re, like, so smart. I don’t even know what they mean half the time.
I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.
Well, that’s how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain’t no party like a Scranton party, ’cause a Scranton party don’t stop.
We should probably head on down and hook up with Jan.
Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?
Oh, no, sorry, it’s an inside joke. There’s this bartender at Stamford who, uh… you know what? You’d just have to be there.
Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I’d love to be a part of one someday.
All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.
Ugh, that would be gross. It’s not even lunch yet.
SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.
Check it out. Hi, I’m Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.
Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.
You know what? I’m having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.
Well, cool! Okay, so… can I tell people you’re gonna be there?
Do you remember me from last year? There’s a party in my room, 308, can’t miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!
All right, Jan just emailed me. She wants us to meet her up front.
I don’t have to, I just know. Yes, hello?
All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
[into phone] See you in a bit. Bye-bye. [to Dwight] May I have a moment of your time please?
I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
I’ll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.
It’s, uh… I was… might ask if you wanted…
[answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He’s not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What’s up?
Um, if, uh… um… I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It’s so weird.
Okay. Well, if you think of it, I’ll be here.
So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there’s any known aliases, et cetera.
Business has been pretty crazy around the office.
I will call him later with that message.
Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?
Oh, no, it was… you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to…
Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.
Michael, it’s really not a competition.
Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope. We can grab lunch with them tomorrow.
Hey, Jan, Jan? Don’t worry, I have got the tip.
No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.
I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
The party I’m having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.
Michael, um… Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can’t stay on top of you 24/7.
You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you’re worth it.
If you do that, you’re going to have to put out.
Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
Well, Jim and I have a meeting with Uni-ball in about forty-five minutes, so we should probably go now.
Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.
Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.
Shut it. [answering phone] Hey, Pam, what’s up? Yep, yech… no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. [to others] Say hi to Pam!
Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. [to others] Pam says hi. [into phone] Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.
Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and… okay. Double or nothing.
Or what?  We didn’t bet anything, Michael.
Say, while I have you here, could I talk to you about some new and exciting advances to our product line?
Okay, let me tell you what we’re looking for.
Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.
Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
Well, Michael, I underestimated you.
Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.
Dwight’s room key. And… Dwight’s room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call… well, I gotta call somebody, I don’t even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.
So how do you come up with your cartoons?
Well, I just, uh… I kinda think about stuff that I see, or dream them.
Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.
I thought there was a party in here.
Party central! So, what can I do you for? [Guy leaves] All right.
See, this one is great, because it can work on a couple of different levels.
[French accent] Freedom fries for the table.
Yeah. I mean, people always say, like, “Don’t be edgy.” But I don’t know any other way. Yeah, you get it.
Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.
Yeah. Next time bring some of your illustrations, I’ll let you pick my brain.
I went on a date. It wasn’t a love connection, um… I think when I like someone again, I’ll just kinda know.
People have been filtering in and out.
Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?
I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales… I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that’s just…
Wait, wait. I didn’t transfer because of you. You’re a good boss. You’re a great boss.
Michael, it’s not about… I transferred because of Pam.
Oh my God. You don’t even know. She’s single now.
No, I just… I heard something about that. It’s just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
I’m sorry, man. I’m sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.
I will. I’ll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you’re feeling.
Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.
Hey, uh… Arnie Reisman. Michael, Jim.
Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [lights go out, leaving Michael’s black light on] Ha, ha, ha.
Today I’m headed to Philadelphia for the annual Northeastern Office Supply Convention. [makes horns gesture and heavy metal scream] Wooo-yaaaaah! Oh, these things tend to be kind of crazy.
[Angela enters Michael’s office] Ah.
Per-diem. [singing as he signs] Perrrr-diiiiieeeemmmm! [shows off $100 bill to Ryan] You know, Ryan, it’s all about the Benjamins.
Yes. What? Oh, yeah, have Pam give those to me.
Gonna be fun! Change your mind we can get you a cot.
Yup. Yeah, I applied for a job there.
What would you have done? Been manager?
You? A bottle capper?! [laughs in disbelief]
I know, I know. Crazy world. Crazy, crazy world.
Yes, I’m aware of Jan and Michael’s… history. Um, I don’t really like to talk about it ’cause it’s unprofessional. Kind of gross.
Josh reminds me of a guy I went to high school with. Big football star, girls loved him. Whatever. Guess what he’s doing now. He’s a TV announcer for the Eagles. Up in the… [laughs] He doesn’t even get to play in the game, I mean.
So, you ever been convicted of a felony?
What? Uh, no. [to Jim] Uh, I want you to make sure you call Karen and get her to fax that vendor list over.
Um… When I was in the Coast Guard, a couple of us broke into the women’s barracks and we got arrested for trespassing.
Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?
[Jim, Josh, and Jan walk in the hotel lobby] Josh, um… [Jim continues walking ahead] Why don’t you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together.
Can we do it over breakfast? It’ll be…
[putting on a good face] Great! [walks off]
Let’s gooooo! Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!
[directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there.  Second from the end.
[walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone?
[with five popcorn bags left] Anyone else?  Nooo.
Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?
Don’t whine.  Get the window. [Dwight exhales]
Ok.  Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play.  So then Lance, he gets sacked, he’s out for the year…
[walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?
Not everyone approves of Movie Monday.  I won’t say who.
Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room]
[Jan walks in on Movie Monday] Hi Jan!  Hope you brought the Milk Duds!
How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that?
No… they have to… to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
[walking past Dwight’s desk] Kitchen.
Michael is going to get us all fired.  You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we’re all going to lose our jobs.
You know she has it out for him now.
That’s not his fault!  He had to follow his heart!
Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan’s been bitching out on him.  Reject a woman and she will never let it go.  One of the many defects of their kind.  Also weak arms.
Dwight, you should be running this office.
It’s not up to Michael, it’s Jan’s call. Talk to her.
Fine!  Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits.  But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.
[on the phone] Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. [Kelly screams with excitement into the phone and Pam has to take it away from her ear]
Kelly really likes to online shop.  Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes.  I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um… just get new clothes.
[pulling her new shirt out of a box] Ok.
You haven’t even tried it on yet, try it on.
Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
[clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!
I’m just killing Germans, any way I can.
We’re on the German team.  Shoot the Brittish.
[turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?
[outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH!  GAH!  [breathing heavily]
This is Dwight Schrute.  I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
You should talk to Michael, and he’ll talk to me, and that way we don’t have to speak to each other.
[exhales] I can’t talk here.  It’s too sensitive.
It’s not about a surprise party is it?
No, but we should discuss that another time.
Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I’m not coming back.
Pull over at exit 40.  There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.  I know you like that store.  Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.
Many of your blouses are Claiborne’s.
[walking into Michael’s office] I’m going… to the dentist.
I have to have an emergency crown put in.
Yes.  It’s a new dentist.  He’s far.  I might be gone… three hours.
Three hours, wow.  Have fun.  [Dwight walks away staring through the blinds at Michael]
New blouse?  Halter top?  Camisole?  Teddy?
Mostly get rid of waste.  Which is half the people there.  And clean house.  [to waitress in diner]  Right here.  It’s all for me.  Thank you.
Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael’s back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.
[shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way.  There’s a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here.  I know you like their earrings.
[on speakerphone with Michael] Michael.
I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
No, it wasn’t.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.
You can’t have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately.
What was Dwight thinking?  That he could turn Jan against me?  She’s my ex-lover!  …ish.
[Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow.
No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.
Isn’t that like your third soda today?
Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it’s game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again?
[with her hands making the rocker sign] Call of Duty!
[sounding upset] Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute?
This is not working, ok?  We are getting slaughtered out there.
Oh, I’m sorry I don’t know… what we’re talking about…
We just need a strategy, ok?  We’re going to set up a trap in the gun room.  All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44?
Are you playing for the other team?!
Saboteur!  I’m going to kill you for real.  This game— the game is over.  I’m really going to shoot you.
No seriously.  You should have an M&M, they’re really good.
Hey.  I thought you weren’t supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you’ve had a crown put in.
They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so…
Maybe that’s why he became a dentist.
Let me see your teeth.  Let me see ’em.  Let me see ’em.
[reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside]  Ahh.  Aaaah.
[exhales] Well then… I am glad you’re ok.
Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?
[in Michael’s office] Wow, this is tough.
Well, I just got off the phone with Jan.  And um… she demoted me.
Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!
And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
I can’t believe this news.  That— wow.
I know.  I told her I didn’t know whether you’d wanna do it… because you’ve always been so loyal to me.  You’ve been my most trusted ally.
Yep, I did.  I did.  But I think… you should do it.
Well… Gosh, if you think I should.  Then I will.
[exhales] Perfect, well, we’re settled.
All right.  Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I… am assistant regional manager.
Assistant to the regional manager.  Thank you Michael, for staying on.   I really appreciate it.
Hey… I can’t imagine this place without you.
[muttering] Can’t you?  That’s so nice.
Well… I guess we should go tell the troops.
Yeah, when I’m ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let’s do it.
Hey, hi, hello.  Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news.  I… am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.
You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.
How does that qualify him to run a branch?
Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody… about loyalty?
Thank you Michael.  I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!  With ferocity!
I have this little vacuum cleaner that’s broken.  If Dwight doesn’t work out, maybe that could be manager.
You alone?  Because I thought together we could—
Oh please, don’t be naive.  But you can be in charge of the women.
[whispering] Look how cute he is!  He’s trying to shoot with a smoke grenade.
I’m sorry what are you whispering about?
I’m sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around.
[her players gun is pointed directly at Jim’s player’s head] Any… last words?  No?
What? [Karen’s player shoots Jim’s player, “You killed Jim Halpert” appears on the screen, Karen giggles]
Wow. Psychopath.  [Karen grins widely at Jim]
Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work.  But I’m gonna keep the clothes.  I mean, it’ll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren’t pajamas.
Well, I guess it’s time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.
It’s a corporate lease Dwight, you’ve earned it.
But you said you liked it.  You’ve always admired it.
Well that was before.  I’m thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it’s a ridiculous choice for this climate.
[Michael finally breaks] Take it back.
I know, Dwight.  I know.  I know.  I know.
Jan called me about your little meeting!
I know, what you did.  I made the whole thing up, Dwight.
I think the Sebring’s cool.  It’s cool.  The Seabring’s cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD.
Oh do you?  Do you like the Sebring— HOW DARE YOU?!  How dare you, Dwight?
[Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don’t fire me.  Please.
Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
[terrified] I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!
[sobbing] I’ll do anything!  Anything!  I’ll do your laundry for a month!  For a year!
I’m sorry!  I’ll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying]
I don’t know if I can trust you anymore.
You can’t.  You can’t.  But I promise I’ll never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?  [Michael exhales]  What can I do?  [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do?  What can I do?
You can get up.  Get up. [Dwight gets up with spit hanging from his lips] And you can hug it out, bitch.  [Dwight and Michael have a firm embrace]
Hug it out, bitch.  That is what men say to each other, after a fight.  They hug it out, and doing so, the just… let it go.  And walk away.  And they’re done.  Not a good idea to say that to a woman however.  I have found.  It doesn’t translate.
[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]
[throws some desk material in the air to signify debris from the grenade explosion, grins as Jim walks away]
Okay. [Jan leaves Michael’s office; Dwight enters]
Hey. [shuts door] Is everything okay?
If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.
What do you know about management, Dwight?
I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That’s a big cost.
Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.
Four nights a week, I sleep under my desk, and then three nights I stay at my place in Toronto. They don’t know about this job up there. It’s a welfare state. Beautiful countries, both of ’em.
Okay. Here we go. Everybody, you know what? It dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted, Let’s get back in there. [no takers] Come on. Movie Monday! Come on, Stanley let’s go.
[standing at the supply shelf] I’m on the phone.
I’m pretty sure Jan said that we’re not supposed to.
Okay, well, we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together, so I guess I will just go play some online Scrabble.
So, she sleeps with him, but she is still in love with the head surgeon, um, the McDreamy guy, and she starts crying, but the dorky doctor, he’s in love with her… [phone rings]
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. … Uh, sure, I’ll get him for you. [to Michael] It’s Jan for you.
I may have a few weeks ago faked a call from Jan in order to get out of a synopsis of, I think it was, Navy: NCIS. Since then, Michael’s been suspicious.
[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone’s left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you… [Karen’s desk is empty]
[kills Jim’s character, giggles] Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You’ll get a big kick out of it. [leaves]
Things are a little bit… different here in Stamford. [shrug] It’s not bad.
All right, I’ll be right back. [goes down pretend stairs]
[laughs uproariously and applauds] Whoo!
Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
Don’t mind if I do.  See you in a minute.  [goes back down pretend stairs and grabs pen from Stanley’s desk]
There you go, fresh from the warehouse.
Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?
But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.
Yeah.  Yes, it’s better.  It’s great.
[breathless] All right.  Okay. [goes back down pretend stairs, crawls on belly to the kitchen for the coffee]
I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys.  Gotta keep the troops entertained.
[after Michael returns with coffee] With cream and sugar?
[on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.
Oookay.  Let me see if I have his cell.  Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan?  Or does somebody miss me?
Attention, everybody.  I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first.  My old boss Ed Truck has died.
Oh, Michael, that’s such terrible news!  You must feel so sad.
Yes, I am.  It’s very sad.  Because he was my boss.
That’s right, you worked with him.  So did Creed.  Well, I’ll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.  Cheer me up.
The news that you just announced?  That Ed died?
Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  It’s… pssssh… .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.
What’s going on with Fairfield County schools?  Karen, did you generate that price list?
Okay, just get it done.  Jim, will you make sure?
[coughing out his words] Suck up!  Josh, did you hear what I said?
Uh, nothing.  They’re just out of Herr’s chips.
But don’t worry about it.  My snack food doesn’t fall under the umbrella of your authority.
Mmm, that’s where you’re wrong.  I’m your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we’re not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.
Yeah.  Must really have you thinkin’.
The older you get, the bigger the chance is you’re gonna die.  You knew that.
He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6.  He slides under an 18 wheeler.  Pop.  It snaps right off.
That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart.
You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.
That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I’m sorry.  Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.
[clears throat] So, I’m not exactly sure how to say this…
You said you didn’t know how to say it.
I didn’t… he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.  And that’s when his head was separated from the rest of him.  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.
I don’t understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn’t even work here.
[on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?
You really don’t get it, do you?  You don’t understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
[scoffs] I’m not sure that’s realistic.
Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.
We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move…
That is not a statue, that is a robot.
I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us.
What the hell are you two talking about?
Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.
You know what, Michael?  I’ve really tried with you today…
Oh do you?  You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.
So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can’t chase us.
Okay, that is a “no” on the on the West Side Market.
Okay, great.  I think that’s enough.  Can I get back to work now?
Wow.  Never pegged you for a quitter.
I am NOT a quitter.  I will do this all day if you want.
Hey.  What are we doing?   What’s the game?  I want in.
Oh, there’s no game.  We’re just trying to get these chips for Karen.
Oh, the vending machines!  How did we miss that?
I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.
And then we checked the fax machine.
Oohh… can you imagine how much blood there was?  If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.  Probably get on Pam.
Well, you know what?  I didn’t wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can’t stop picturing it.  He leaves work, he’s on his way home… wham!  His cappa is detated from his head!
Excuse me, I’m sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam.  There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.
[as they leave] There’s nothing wrong with your car.  I just thought you might like a break from the “grief counseling” session.
I think so.  I don’t know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.
[laughs]  Well, you’re not still driving so fast, are you?   Yeah.
[as Pam returns to conference room] Okay, we can start.  Um…
Yeah.  Pam, you’re a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?
Okay, why don’t you throw the ball to somebody else.
[returning ball to Stanley] Oh, yes Stanley.  Come on.  Your turn, you have to go.
Okay… I’m going to toss the ball to Pam.
Wow.  If you wanna cry, that’s okay.
Do you want to talk about it anymore?
Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
Me, me, me, me, me me. [catches ball]  Yes.  Okay, um.  I was trying to throw this party once.  And everyone was over for the weekend.  And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had  to pretend like he was alive, so…
Wait a second.  That’s Weekend at Bernie’s. [upset] Do you think that this is a game?
You are not leaving.  No!  We are not done.
We really have a lot of work to do right now.
Yeah.  Well, you know what?  The guy who had my job has died.  And nobody cares!  And he sat at my desk. [breaking down]
Michael, look.  I know this is hard for you, but death’s just a part of life.  I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die.  And I had to keep going.
That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing?
Was its heart beating, Toby?  Did you check it?  No, of course you didn’t.  You’re not a veterinarian.  You don’t know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying]
Michael! [following Michael downstairs] Michael.   Michael …
No, he’s not. [cradling bird next to face]
Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!
Well, you can’t get diseases from a bird!
A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
Attention everybody.  This will only take a second of your time.  Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
Well, I’m sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it.
No, no, no!  That’s enough!  You know what?  This bird is dead.  He died alone.  The least you can do is be there for him now. [to Dwight] Find a box for him.
I’m calling a supermarket in Montreal.
[on phone] Bonjour.  Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr’s.  Non?  Ah… merci quand meme.  Au revoir.
It’s okay.  It’s okay. [pats Kelly on shoulder] Shh… yes, I know, I know. It’s been a tough day, but it’s good to let it show.
I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?
[trying to shove bird into a can] Argh… gah!
What?  No, this is about the right size.
No, God, no it’s not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!?
I’m sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute.
I need a box.  I need a box.  A small box… not too confining.
I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box]
If you wanna do something for the funeral…
Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
Did I wake up this morning thinking I’d be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.
[spotting Herr’s chips on her desk] Where’d you find them?
I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
You made this?  Wow. [impressed] That’s… that’s very nice.
When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking “I’m a little too old for this.”  And I was
I’d also like to say a few words if that’s okay.
What do we know about this bird?  You might think, “Not much.  It’s just a bird.”  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it’s that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.
Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny.
And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don’t think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.
[singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within… on the wings of love …
Society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that’s baloney, because grief isn’t wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.
Hey Jimmy. Want to see some pictures of my baby?
That’s okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it’s not. I’m sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?
You think we should have left our baby in the tub alone? [Jim shakes head] Talk to me when you have kids.
[on the phone] Ed Truck died over the weekend.
Yeah. And I know… I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.
I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.
…’Cause I’m the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over? [Jan hangs up]
Ed Truck died. And it blows. They say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because I found out before anybody so I’ve had more time to be sad.
Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all.
May he rest in pieces. [chuckles] You know, because there’s, like, two pieces of him.
Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He’s trained as a grief counselor.
Well, I am trained in grief counseling, but, ahh, I don’t think that’s what they need right now.
Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesn’t it?
Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I’ve never met.
That sucks. [laughs] You guys got it much harder up here.
Well, as you know, Ed Truck passed away. So, I’m here to talk about it if anyone would like to.
You’re ruining it, already. They should not be given the choice.
I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way.
Is anyone having any trouble eating?
Concentrating? Is anyone having trouble getting their work done today?
I’m having trouble getting my work done today.
Well, look, sometimes things crop up later. So, uhh, you should know I’m always available if anyone would like to talk.
Wow. Wow. No. No. You are the most heartless, soulless person I’ve ever met.
Okay. I don’t think Kevin should take his shoes off.
My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition.
I found an exercise in Toby’s binder that he managed to miss, that involves screening the part of you that says, “I don’t wanna do that. I don’t wanna talk about that. That is too private.” Here’s how it works. I’m going to throw you this ball.
Yeah, the ball-throwing exercise is in the binder. It’s in the section marked, “Fun Ways To Make Brainstorming Sessions Explode With Excitement and Creativity.”
Hey, my cousin Billy, they just had the twins.
Wow, I thought that was supposed to be, like, next month.
Yeah, I know. I guess they couldn’t wait. I’ll bring in a picture if you…
Yeah, I’d love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, “Congratulations.”
[in his office playing with a Dunder Mifflin Truck when it drops and the “head” of the Truck comes off]
Michael once told me that Home Alone is the saddest movie ever. When I asked him why, he said, “Because the whole family forgets the kid at home. There is nothing funny about that.”
That’s… Hold it, hold it, hold it. Start, like, right in there. [Dwight digs hole in ground] Just dig.
Okay, give it to me. You don’t know what you’re doing. All right. [Michael starts digging]
Hey! Hey! What are you guys doing over there?
Nothing. Let’s just… all right. [talks to warehouse guys] Guys, do you have a box we could use?
No, I said one of them is not a nickel.
But the other one is. I’ve heard that before.
Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, …
Because he’s my son. The doctor is the boy’s mother.
A man is found hanging from the ceiling…
He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
It’s a polar bear because you’re at the North Pole.
I don’t care how your day was Michael.
Wow. Well. Ok. I don’t care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?
I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?
Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.
I’m great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?
It’s weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it’s like he’s five.
Extremely excited? … Just very?  That’s cool.
I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight’s the top salesman in the company and he’s taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I’m excited.
I am very excited. Ryan hasn’t made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn’t made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?
So what if they’re not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just ’till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where’s the sales office?
When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.
No, I didn’t. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn’t take your chair.
When you get up, I’m just going to take it back anyway, so…
Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.
I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When… Damn it.
Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.
Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?
That’s it? That’s what you came up with?
Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.
Attention Scranton Business Park, there will be complimentary pretzels in the lobby from now until 4 o’clock as a thank you to our loyal tenants.
Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It’s really not a big deal. To some people it is.
[looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh… Come on.
And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I’m going to plant my seed in you.
I don’t think you know what you’re saying.
It’s called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  I’ll be right back.
I wake up every morning in a bed that’s too small, drive my daughter to a school that’s too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.
Because they acted all tough and everything…
But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to…
[Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?
Boooooo. Thank you. [hi-five’s Stanley]. That’s right.
Hey Dwight, you’re a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I’ll make you the ole commodor.  I’ll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I’ll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
I don’t care ’bout anything but you… what ever happened to those guys?
No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I’d like to see. You read my mind.
Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You’re an angel.
Hey, why don’t you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I’ll just bring you a pretzel.
Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.
You know, I just think it’s really important that you be productive today.
Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I’ll be back.
It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you’re doing. I get it.
You know what your problem is? You know why you haven’t made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.
Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?
Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won’t hang out with Mose so much anymore.
What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.
Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin’s suicide?
Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
I can’t believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
He’s not weird, he’s just individualistic.
Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott’s greatest fear?
Wrong. He’s not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it’s all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.
No. Ok. All right. All right. It’s over. This is over.  OK.
No, you’re a freak. I’m not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
Ryan. Don’t. Ryan! You don’t have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
You still mad? It’s just Jim and I didn’t get along, and I didn’t want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
Look, that, that’s not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
[Michael is listening to “Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter” and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey!
Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What’s going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let’s make a deal. So what is the deal?
Establish time frames. Keep the phrase “real dollars” in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That’s why you’re losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.
Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
Ok, I’m going to establish time frames.
I’m going to put everything in terms of “real dollars”.
I’m going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
I’m going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second…
Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.
Account…? Michael, what is going on?
Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?
They did not. They didn’t have to say it to your face.
I don’t get it. I don’t get what I did wrong.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He’s, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.
[Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.
These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?
Sorry, I forgot Kevin’s extension. It’s a fantasy football thing.
And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn’t think you’d be there. Why, why are you still there?
I had to work late. Jan’s making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
Uh, no, I um. Everything’s pretty much the same here.
A little different. What time is it there?
What time is it here? Um, we’re in the same time zone.
How many words per minute does the average person type?
Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn’t even type 90.
Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
So ok. I’m watching the movie, by myself…
Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home…
But I’m holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don’t put the pictures on the box.
Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.
Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
Most apartments these days have like three.
Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
[Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok?
Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
Three hundred and sixty four days, ’till the next Pretzel Day.
What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.
Well, that’s really not the way I roll, because sometimes I’m in the zone, and sometimes I’m in the zoning out.
Do you want me to go on Amazon and order you a slang dictionary? Cause I’ll do it.
…then maybe corporate can justify your salary.
It’s like mommy and daddy are fighting. Except mommy outranks daddy and mommy is way scarier.
…because you are never going to see him again.
Today is Ryan’s first sales call and I am bringing this boy home a full-grown man.
Would you look at that? [Hugs Ryan] [Dwight attempts hug] Damn it, Dwight! Come on.
Dwight is taking Ryan on a sales call today. So if we find Ryan’s body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow, I owe Jim $30. It’s an old bet, but a deal’s a deal.
I once saw a movie called “Training Day”. It starred an African-American and Ethan Hawke. In it, the African-American trains Ethan Hawke with various tests and trials. Today, Ryan is Ethan Hawke, and I am the African-American.
Don’t you realize the key is inside you? [pretends to pull key out of Ryan’s ear]
He’s the top salesman at the company. He’s the top salesman at the company. He’s the top salesman at the company. Today’s gonna be great.
No, but seriously, your ears are the key. 90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.
Get in the car. [Ryan knocks the car door] Get… get in the car.
Sales is not all in here. [wails arms] It’s also in here.
[wails arms] You know, selling, typing, dialing.
What is that in your ear? [pretends to pull beet seed out of Ryan’s ear] A tiny beet seed. You need to clean your ears better.
It’s going okay. I’ve already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I’d know.
Okay. That sounds good. [puts banana in toy mouth that’s in his mouth] [laughs] Yes. Actually, today’s a good day to do that.
Sales is about people, Ryan. About understanding them and learning how to get along with them. Case study:
[in the kitchen and Stanley comes in and swipes Kevin’s pretzel without Kevin seeing] Shoot.
There’s four things that I love. My wife, my daughters, Pam Grier, and a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough.
I mean, they’re just dough twisted up with some candy. They taste so good in my mouth.
That’s what she said. [Stanley and Michael both laugh]
Look, I’ve never seen a Clint Eastwood movie.
But if you said “Go ahead, make my day,” I would know that it’s from “Dirty Harry”. How can you not know that’s from “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off”?
Yo, mama! Ask me how bad I wanted to bone Jennifer Grey.
I saw the movie. I just don’t know every line from the film.
You didn’t know that “Bueller?” was from Ferris Bueller?
Let’s just say, me and Jennifer Grey probably would’ve broken a few laws.
Ok, so, between Meredith’s Mini-van and if I borrow Bob’s Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
Do you want to make Appletini’s and watch ‘Sex and the City’ at my place?
Oh, I don’t know. I haven’t decided yet.
I don’t get why you won’t go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
I just feel kind of tired, you know.
Maybe. I just …I don’t really have anyone to go with.
Well, go with Dwight. He’s single, too. Right?
Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.
Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
I don’t know. Who’s… uh, who’s going?
Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?
Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do… sign me up… because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
It’s important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.
I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di… don’t really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don’t want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.
Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I’m a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.
Um… Diwali is awesome… and there’s food… and there’s going to be dancing… and… Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um…
Um… why don’t you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
Oh, um… I don’t know. It’s really old, I think.
Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
[points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What’s her story?
She looks like Pam from the neck down.
Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I’ll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil…
All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn’t ‘Lord of the Rings’.
I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape… helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
Just stop it. [slide of Michael & Carol kissing] What’s the… oh, whoa! [laughs] Where did that come from?
Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again. I need your skinny, little arms.
We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I.
Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It’s very Sam and Diane.
And another thing about the Indian people… they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who’s seen that before?
I have. That’s the ‘Union of the Monkey’.
This is the best meeting we’ve ever had.
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn’t all be subjected to it.
Actually, she’s right. This isn’t appropriate. Why don’t I take these.
No, You’re not going to collect them.
No. This is delightful, charming culture.
My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It’s just sex. People… everybody does it. I’m doing it… with Carol! Probably tonight.
All right. Think you guys should be all set. Oh, here’s the corporate card for dinner.
And Karen? Let’s keep it to twenty dollars a person this time.
Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation… which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
Stop it. It’s a disease! I’ve told you.
[wearing cheerleader costume] I thought you said this was a costume party!
[points at woman] What does that look like to you?
Hey, Kevin. It’s a costume. Why don’t you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.
I’ll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions…
I’ll just have some bread. You used your hands.
They’re not s’mores. They’re samosas.
All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?
[laugh] Kelly Zach Braff [speaks in Hindi]
Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
They said something about Zach Braff.
Don’t even listen to them. They’re so…
I decided to come. Uh… I feel a little under-dressed… but at least I’m not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?
I don’t even want to hear it. Okay. I didn’t come this Diwali to get yelled at!
Stop it right now. Ryan is a temporary worker, makes no money. Wally is a whole doctor. So handsome.
[song by Beyonce Knowles] Looking so crazy, my baby. I’m not myself lately. I’m foolish. I don’t do this. I’ve been playing myself. Baby I don’t care. Cuz your love got the best of me. And baby you’re making a fool of me.
Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?
How long have you been married to the cheerleader?
Oh! She’s not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um… no, we’re not married… yet!
She is. Very fair and very kind. So… um… tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It’s still very cool. Ok. Thanks!
[louder] Can we talk about this in private?
[lowers microphone] Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me. Okay.
No. I get it. I get it. You’re not ready. We’ll wait. This is a classic…
Yeah, well, but I … I feel like I’ve known you many lifetimes. Maybe I’m Hindu after all. Okay, I’m not Hindu, but… Carol. Carol, I just… I feel like… I just like you so much.
I better go. Okay, you can find a way home, all right?
Ok. Okay. Good night. [louder] Hey, you know what? Why don’t I come with you. Cause I’ve got this book called the Kama Sutra.
Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um… the compensation is a lot more competitive.
Oh, um… or travel. And,um… and buy an Xbox.
Is there anything you wanted to ask us tonight?
Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.
Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?
Dry. You look like you were having fun.
I am. You should come dance with us.
I have to watch our shoes so they don’t get stolen. Who were you texting?
[sings Indigo Girls] I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children…
[sings] I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.
[sing] There’s more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line
[sing] the closer I am to fi-i-i-ne. The closer I am to..
Wow. Pam. When Carol said ‘No.’ tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.
Well, you were never really engaged.
I was in that marriage arena, though.
I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
We’re so alike. So alike. [leans in to kiss her]
[scoffing noises] Can I have a ride home?
Can I have a ride, man? I… uh… I have my bike.
No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You’re welcome to share it though. It’s a roomy twin.
Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just… uh… get in the car.
Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that’s all right.
Sure. Here’s your bag. Just don’t puke on anything. You okay?
These are not my shoes. This is just like that show ‘Taxi Cab Confessions’.
You say one more word; I’m stopping the car.
[loud clapping, cheering, and whistling]
Um, well, basically, it’s like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there’s a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?
Oh, please, stop talking. Three words or less.
An Indian Halloween. Okay, great. [to phone] Pam, could you put Jan on, please?
[on phone] Michael, you’re on with Jan.
Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?
Well, I was letting everybody go to the big Diwali party.
You don’t know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I’m surprised. It’s the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you’d be familiar with it. It’s the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It’s like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween—
I bet you’re not even aware that our own Kelly Kapoor, who works in…
… customer service is a Hindu person.
Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.
Yes, of course. It’s important to celebrate our company’s rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event—
—or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.
Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric—
For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band.
No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and… Better yet, I’ll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It’ll save us both on postage.
Top of your class at business school, and you live on Shady Hill Road, right?
He says… “I love him.” He loves you.
At Cornell, in my fraternity, my house name was “Hubble” because I was so good at finding a party. I was like a powerful space telescope, so… Freshman year, when my skin was still really bad, they called me El Guapo.
And perhaps the most important person to Indian culture, Sir Ben Kingsley. Because of him, the British left India, and then he became an actor like Ronald Reagan.
Who are you faxing so early in the morning?
No![knocks coffee out of Stanley’s hand.] You’ll thank me later.
…thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.
[singing] Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.
I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
The board voted last night to close your branch.
I’m very sorry. I don’t relish telling you this. You’ve been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
Am I a small number person or a severance package person?
Well, we haven’t made final decisions about personnel yet. But you’re a severance package person.
Oh… [burrys head in hands] Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don’t really get it ’cause we’re not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.
Well, it’s not all about numbers, Michael.
Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company’s future.
Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?
Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley’s daughter from Stanley’s desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast.
Don’t say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
Sorry. I just feel like we haven’t talked in awhile.
Well… we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work … while you still can.
Hey, um… did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is… [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head]
Um, sorry… the Scranton branch is closing? [Karen nods and Andy looks at Jim] In your face!
Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.
Nothing. Just checking in. I can’t tell you, so…
Nothing, Pam.[whispers to himself] What difference does it make?  We’ll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
You just said that we’re gonna be gone…?
[facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody… I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.
Michael, uh… we shouldn’t be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.
You knew about this all along, didn’t you?
Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.
What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
I don’t know. Probably not. This is the worst.
It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
I don’t want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone’s to blame.
If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.
[surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!
I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it’s going to be weird that it’s all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
I couldn’t be happier. I’m gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn’t be happier.
It’s a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, “Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.” So, maybe that’ll stop now.
Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.
I don’t really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, “You Don’t Know What You Got (Till It’s Gone)”? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it… in words.
Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
I know, I know. Well, I’ll land on my feet. Don’t worry about me.
So, you’ll be okay too. You’re a warrior. You’re smart, capable. You’ll find something else and…
Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he’s keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.
All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at  Dwight] Let’s go.
Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he’s making a mistake… save the branch.
Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won’t be coming back into the office.
But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.
You sent him cards? You never met him.
But when I do, we’ll have something to talk about.
I know it’s not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who’s coming over here from Scranton?
Okay, so is it like sales or… accountants?
You know what, Jim, I wouldn’t worry about it.
Oh, good. You’re both here. Ready to talk logistics?
[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I’m gonna go someplace else and you’re gonna go someplace else. It just doesn’t make sense.
This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael’s gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it’s for the best.
So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you’ll be his number two.
Excuse me, Jan, I’m sorry… I’m gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job.
As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples.
You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I…
I’m sorry, all right? It’s done, it’s done.
Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
So, do you know what you’re gonna say when he shows up?
I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I’ll be him, you be you. Let’s practice.
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum… coming home from work.
Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?
Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It’s simple dollars and cents.
Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.
Listen, Scott… we’re losing money, okay? It’s not a charity; it’s a business. And it’s a dying business.
[no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop… stop it! Just, okay. He’s not going to say any of that.
Because he’d be intimidated and I, just… let’s start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do… coming home from work…
So… we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.
And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.
No, it’s just I’m not sure if I um… well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um…
No. No, no. Just um… some personal stuff. And I’m not really ready to revist that, I don’t think.
Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.
Hey guys. Uh, I’m trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we’re never gonna see each other again.
I don’t want to go all the way to Dunmore.
Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?
Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.
[takes bottle and cleans off cap with his tie]
He’s not here. I don’t know where he is.
[looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha… what’s going on here?
We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.
Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is… and tell him.
Sure, uh, Jan… um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?
Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
[referring to Michael’s ringing phone] who is it?
No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.
I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
That’s, um… I hadn’t thought about it, huh.
I just don’t want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs… so, good news, right?
Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I’m so happy we don’t have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!
I really don’t know.  How you doing with all this?
You know, I’m fine. I’ll be better when I know if I have a job.
Yeah, if they let me, I think I… I think I would.
New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I’d move to New York?
Yeah, you know… I might do that. I, who knows? I… I might do that.
[after screaming and throwing papers around in the kitchen] What’s up, Josh?
I just want to say thanks. Good luck.
What if this doesn’t work? What is the office actually goes under?
Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
[pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.
My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
Uh,… my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
Oh, right. Okay, that’s enough. That’s good.
Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.
What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
Hey Pam, we’re going to Poor Richards. Creed’s buying shots.
Yeah, man! I’m uh… I’m really glad you’re still gonna be working here.
Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There’s another annoying boss, another desk, I’d have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.
Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton… it’s not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
Yeah, I’m happy he said that. I mean, I don’t think he’s into me or anything, but, I’m kind of into him. So…there you go.
What are we still doing here? It’s over. Let’s go home. Get the car.
Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody’s jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!
Stranford is closed! Michael, we’re not closed. Stamford is closed. Stamford is closed.
Right here! Right here! [pounds his chest against Dwight’s]
Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I’m 65.
So what’s he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men’s magazines?
You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.
Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I’m out of here. See you later?
Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh’s computer?
[scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.
Yeah, well my feet don’t. And I can still crush that time.
Let’s just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
I am fast. To give you a reference point. I’m somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
Karen Filip… [In Italian voice] Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That’s all I’m going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. [exhales]
I’m not firing somebody on the first day.
The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do… set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who’s way out of your league.
Yes! I’m in a good mood today! I’m excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That’s always a thing that makes people happy… to have an old friend back.
Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So…  As far as I’m concerned, [holds up WORLD’S BEST BOSS mug] this says ‘World’s Best Dad’.
Ah! There he is Tony… what’s your last name?
Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag… for you. [laughs] Okay.
Well, they’re just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.
Wh..and coupons… to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
Really? That’s so cool. I’ve always wanted to learn…
Welcome, welcome, welcome! [in robot voice] Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.
Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
Mmm… dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?
I’ll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I’m always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.
Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and… hello.
A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.
They are nifty! They’re nifty gifties.
You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.
…which is why they need a passing game.
[to Jim] No way. Get him out of here. We don’t want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
[to Martin] How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. [shakes head] Not… so, your desk is…
Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we’d never met…
Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
Where do I stand with Pam? Um… no idea. I mean, we’re friends. Always have been friends. Um… .that is where we stand.
Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
Fact – I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Hey! How are you man? Good to see… you.
Oh, I’m sorry. Are you sitting here now?
Um… unless you really, really want it back.
You know, man, it’s really you’re call.
Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That’s why I got the desk.
Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says: Personnel Files Stamford CT Office Confidential] Can you take care of it?
In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
Hello. I don’t believe we’ve been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
I know everything about film. I’ve seen over 240 of them.
How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump]
No, it’s nothing. We’ll just… [shakes hand]
This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred… a credit card. It will shred… oh! [whispers] Shoot.
[talking to himself] I present the orientation video.
Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.
I don’t care! Dwight! You all report to me! That’s all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?
Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don’t we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For… drum roll, please [makes drum roll noises], the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!
Nope. Um… for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.
Well, then… consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
No, it’s not beef… just… sit down, please. [talks to group] Welcome. Help yourself.
Um… You might want these orientation materials.
Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.
Sittin’ in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin’.
Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
The Electric City. Call poison control if you’re bit by a spider.
But check that it’s covered by your health care provider!
It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. ‘The Scranton Witch Project’.
[in video] I am so scared… when people don’t label their personal food.
You like coal mines and you wanna see ’em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
But the little cars go in the compact spot
[on video in background] Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
Well, so far, I think it is killin’. I thought it would either be an ‘A’ or an ‘A+’ but I completely forgot that there’s an ‘A++’.
[recording phone message] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
[recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Not bad, but you are Italian so… try it more Italian.
[recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
[recording phone message] Karen Filippelli.
Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that’s how it works.
Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin’ on the charm.
Hey, Angela. Check this out. It’s my new screen saver.
Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.
Oh yeah. I’m trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or… you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
Oh! Um… tonight, actually? No. I’m uh just still getting settled.
Nope. You’re not interrupting anything. Nope. I’m…
All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
The day’s going fine. It’s been a little chaotic but it’s fine. It’s great! A lot of distractions. But, it’s good.
[using breast pump] Take a picture. It’ll last longer.
I’m sorry. It’s just, it’s a little distracting.
Must be an… air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.
I… I… I, uh, think I’m just allergic to your perfume.
It’s just my crazy nose. I’m… uh, used to different smells.
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It’s made from real pine.
You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
I don’t know who these new people think they are. I’ve sat downwind of Phyllis’ stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
[sings drum beat intro to ‘What is Love?’]
You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why’s my nose so itchy!
Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.
[laughs hysterically] Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
All right, all right, I’m on a roll.
Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
No. I mean I can’t physically. I can’t get on the table.
Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
Don’t be shy! Dwight! Let’s do this!
Come on. We’re doing this thing! Let’s get up.
Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I’m under this… I’m under this hock here. I don’t know what I’m grabbing here.
All right. All right. Stop. Put me down.
We’ve almost got it. Push it! Push it!
I was on the fence about this and… it’s just not a good fit.
You can’t quit! On the first day. That’s [deep voice] heresy, my friend! [regular voice] Okay, let’s talk about this. What happened? I mean, what… Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he’s… what?
No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It’s just your management style.
My management style? So… didn’t you think ‘Lazy Scranton’ was funny?
Okay. Well, don’t bother quitting because you’re fired.
You are fired! I’m sorry, but we don’t have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
But there’s nothing in my desk except coupons.
Don’t try to apologize to me, man! It’s too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
That was my advice. Remember? I’m the one who suggested that you fire him.
Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.
And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would ‘none’ be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win… the next battle.
Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional.
Maybe that’s because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.
Back to work. We don’t have to get along. We just have to work together.
No. We do have to get along. Can’t we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.
The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.
Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
Yeah! They punk’d us! They punk’d us good! Come on. Come on!
Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?
Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.
I don’t… I don’t think we can do that.
Hey! Why doesn’t your car have a flat tire?
Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It’s so hateful. [reads note] “You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!”
No. No, no, no. No.  You are falling for it. You’re playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don’t, oh…
[to Stanley] What’s up with this guy?
THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!
Oh, we find little times during the day.
Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he’d fill all our tires up.
Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
But do you realize that that was actually Dwight’s idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
He’s the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.
So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.
If he even wants it. It doesn’t come with a pay raise.
So who will be your new Number Three?
Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.
Thank you, Andy. That’s… very kind. Thanks.
Shut it! That’s… [whispers to camera] suck up!
[talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
[off camera] I’m at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
[laughs] What’s wrong? You didn’t have a good first day?
Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper’s in an hour? I need a drink.
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I… . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
Uh… no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today… or something.
I just think I should tell you that… I’ve sort of started seeing someone. And uh…
Oh. That’s totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
We’re friends. We’ll always be friends.
Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?
Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
Yeah, my Xterra’s pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.
Actually, it is. It’s Latin for “earth.”
That makes sense. I’d rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.
Well I hope 1985 has a time machine ’cause I drive an 87.
Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.
Speaking of funerals, why don’t you go ahead and go die.
Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.
If I were an idiot, I’d be driving a TransAm.
If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
[coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That’s why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.
And this is, don’t tell me, Martin… Ne… Ne…Nack.
Mocha complexion. Supplier relations. Either caught a fish or was standing next to a man who caught a fish in Key West, Florida.
[holds up piece of paper] It wasn’t clear on the Google Image search.
Hey, man. Good. Listen, my M&M’s are under the desk if you want any.
Smart. Good. [to Angela] Hey, Angela.
[to Angela] It’s his first day back.
His hair’s flipping out on the sides.
This is weird with you facing the other way.
Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed. [Pam chuckles] Hey, who’s that guy? [Jim points to Stanley]
What about, uh.. [points at Meredith]
[Pam nods head] You should say hi. Use her full name.
Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner? [points to Creed]
Uh, that is Creed Bratton. He has four toes and he fought in the Civil war.
Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys… I’m trying to get some work done.
Sorry. Man. [Pam hesitates and then leaves]
[notices Karen has same thermos as herself] Hey. That’s funny.
[holds out flask] Do you want a little?
Okay. If you change your mind, you just let me know, okay?
[approaching Kevin to shake hand] Hi, Andy Bernard.
What’s that on your shirt? [points to Andy’s shirt]
Hey, girls. What’s happening? Startinng to blend? Well, before long, you guys keep hanging out, you guys you are gonna share the same menstrual cycle.
[sniffs. Pans to Creed eating his mungbeans.]
[pushing back desk item] Here you go.
Yeah, I mean my stuff’s coming over, but umm… is this…is this yours? [holds up travel mug]
Well… I… Hey. You’ve never met me before.
I know, but you just give off the vide of a guy who’s getting thinner.
You know who I really like? That guy, Andy.
Can’t we all get along?  No, we can’t. But here’s the thing:
I need somebody to pick a card. [Dwight raises hand] One of the new people, please? Tony? [Tony walks away]
[starts clapping] Very good Michael. Really good. [Michael shushes Dwight]
So I think in order for us all to work together well we must come together as a family and then we can all be [starts to fan out the rest of his cards facing the group showing kings of hearts] a king of hearts.
[clapping] No, no, it’s better than fantastic. It’s super perfect.
What I want all of you [points at Scranton branch] to do is approach one of the new people and tell them the one thing that you like most about them. Who wants to start? Who wants to give it a shot?
Okay Meredith, let’s give it a shot.
[to Martin] I love your complexion. It’s like devil’s food cake.
[clapping] Beautiful. Very good, nice.
It just goes to show you, you play with fire and you are gonna singe your eyebrows. And they do not grow back the same way. [takes of glasses and points to right eyebrow]
It is inspiring to me to watch you navigate these murky waters.
Bull… [bleep] [clears throat] Sorry.
We heard what you said. You didn’t cover it at all.
[points at camera] They’re gonna have… You can’t say that, all right?
I can’t say [clearinng throat noise]?
[clearing throat noise] Idiot. Dwight’s an idiot! Did you catch that or did… did the cough cover it?
[cleaing throat] You’re a jerk. Dwight’s a jerk!
…Oh, sorry. He’s–he’s dressed all in pink.
Yes. I have started to see Karen. It’s very new, and… not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or… I dunno. Just, not yet.
Yeah, Jan, it um… looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don’t know.
Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.
Look, we have a rebate from… the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.
We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
I didn’t hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist. [Jan sighs] … I’m just kidding.
Okay, that’s when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.
One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.
Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I’m not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.
Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.
…Okay it’s someone named Martin Nash.
Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy… who went to prison for… polluting a black guy’s lake.
In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and… saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.
Why would anyone go to jail for that?
Sssssso, what we need to do… is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.
Sure. Let’s protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack.
Next. How about… [motions toward Angela]. Blondes are more fun. C’mon, trust me on that.
Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?
I’m cool, I’m cool, I’m so cool. Tell me what is going on.
Um… Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. [Dwight starts to run] No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!
I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.
All… righty, let’s get started. What is she into?
I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates…
I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.
Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also… do you speak pig latin?
…Danny Glover. [Jim raises hand] Yeah.
So… you all wanna know what I was in for?
No. That’s not cool. You don’t have to tell them.
Um, I really don’t mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I… got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink.
I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because… it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But… at least we got outdoors time.
Two hours, every day. Sometimes we’d play pickup football games…
Michael, why don’t we get outdoors time?
Well, we are running a business, so.
Not good. Uh… a little bit bigger than Michael’s office… but, you know, I really only slept there. You know, during the day, there-our time’s our own. They had uh, classes, I took some… watercolor classes.
They did, taught by some uh, Harvard business school guys–a lot of the guys also, that were in the class, the inmates, a lot of them have gone on to do extraordinary things in business.
Kinda sounds like… prison’s… better than Dunder-Mifflin.
This place is not prison. It’s… way better than prison.
[singsong voice] Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this?
You can’t give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow.
Oh, it’s okay. I’ve got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo?
Shh. Think about it. I’ll hit you back.
Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let’s go!
Why don’t we… pump some iron? Anyone wanna… pump up?
It’s uh… two and a half. I’m not going for bulk, I’m going for tone.
Yeah, it’s… freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you’ve got about… twenty-seven minutes of rec time.
Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?
Actually, our TV was bigger than that one.
These people don’t realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.
Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
Quick question – do you play the guitar?
Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that’ll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
I’m gonna go get my banjo out of my car.
…I’m messing with Andy. I’m sending him to all the women in the office with… just… terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
I love it. I want in. Who’s the target?
…Oh, you know what? … It was… gonna be Pam, but…
Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment.
Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam… we’ll give her a break. Let’s think of someone else.
Do you really expect us to believe you’re somebody else?
Michael, please. [Michael makes kissing noises]
And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I’m saying. It’s not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.
I stole. … And I robbed. And I kidnapped… the… president’s son. And held him for ransom.
That is… quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
Well, you’re… in… prison, but, mmhmm.
Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.
Prison Mike. What’s the very very worst thing about prison?
The worst thing about prison was the… was the Dementors. They… were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they’d come down, and they’d suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!
Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter?
Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.
Yeah, that… wasn’t really… at all my experience. There were certain elements of what you performed, I’ve seen on television. But it didn’t remind me of my time in prison.
Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. [locks employees in conference room]
No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it’s like to have freedom. And if this doesn’t bother them, then I am out of ideas.
[knocking on door] Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have–
[answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from?
Michael. Why’s everyone locked in the conference room?
They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
Well, you’re going to have to let ’em out. Or… or I will.
Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.
You know they’re teasing you. I mean… obviously, this is… a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have… we have parties here. They’re teasing you. To be funny.
[unlocks door] Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don’t you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!
[singing] So we’ve been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they’re wrong, wait and see, ’cause one day we’ll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee…
Don’t worry, she’s dead. Oh wait. He’s dead.
I accidentally ran over it. It’s a Christmas miracle!
Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
[to Pam] So can you watch this? I’m gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
No, Toby, this is different. He’s already dead.
Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn’t want to see it killed.
I like goose. If it’s already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.
Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.
It’s a dead animal in an office. You can’t…
OK…  Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it’ll fit, with all these little knickknacks.
Well, that is probably from the test drive.
But the paint’s chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
Oh, thanks. [Michael and Andy do a fist bump and explosion.]
Yes? [Pam holds up a bag] Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn’t have to do that.
[hands over bag] I didn’t, it’s from corporate.
[Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you’re supposed to put a toy
[Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol.
There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello [kisses Carol] You’re about five hours early to the party. You’re such a blonde. [laughs]
Hey, everybody. I don’t know who you haven’t met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend – Carol. This is just the front of her. Show ’em, show ’em the other side.
Turn around, turn around. Come on. [making a body turning gesture]
If I may say. She’s even prettier that you described her.
[standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don’t think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
I really need a moment alone with you. [Carol heads towards Michael’s office.]
Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. [puts finger on her back and reaches for her butt] Berp.
What is this? [Holds up a Christmas photo]
That is my Christmas card. It’s a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.
No. See, we never went on a ski trip.
Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.
Yes, but what you didn’t realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart…
It’s a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael’s a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?
But, um, I don’t know how to deal with, with this thing [waves Christmas card]. And, and the proposal. And I don’t think things are going to work out with us.
No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you’re not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in [making drum noise] Jamaica’s largest fresh water pool.
I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. [Carol shakes head in disappointment]. You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.
No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.
Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I’ll just tell you.
For the past few months I’ve been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim]
They’re considering him for a top secret mission. There’s his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he’d never ever tell.
[Opens folder and reads from Dwight’s file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
So… here’s the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn’t wrap it.
[closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don’t think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.]
I feel like there’s a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then … what am I doing?
I’d like everybody’s attention. Christmas is canceled.
Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year’s.
Jim, take New Year’s away from Stanley.
Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don’t think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
[over everybody else’s talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
Fine! [everybody stops talking] Have your party. Just no guests.
Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.
It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.
OK, well, why are you laying like that?
[moves a little] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?
Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?
And not that you didn’t want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I’m referring to?
Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we’re one bathrobe short.
Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?
Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- [Dwight grabs bag with robe in it and walks away.] Why?
Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
I thought you said green was whorish.
Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle … [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement].
These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of “A Nutcracker Christmas.” I think you should leave.
You tried this out, and it’s clearly not for you. It’s time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]
What are you doing? [“Goodbye My Lover” by James Blunt plays]
[putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
Hey, what’s the haps? [Dwight shuts door in his face.]
Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It’s riddled with Carol’s name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to “Goodbye My Lover” on computer]
Why don’t you just buy the whole song?
I don’t have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just… I just want a little taste of it.
[singing] Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. [hits repeat again]
This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.
I feel like I’ve been kinda cold to Karen and there’s no real reason for it. I mean it’s not like she’s ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn’t be cold to her.
Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.
Yeah, right? I’m so glad you said that. Because, I don’t know how those meetings usually go.
Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?
I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh]
Um, I really liked your karaoke idea.
Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin’s back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.]
This should’ve been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer]
[Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The “Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?” There’s no such thing as the “Committee to Plan Parties.”
Well, you just can’t start a committee. You have to have funding.
[pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.
No, that is not a party. There’s only one party and it’s hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o’clock.
Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There’s a party that starts at three.
And then there’s a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.
Right, and if you’re interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela’s flyer.]
Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that’s what you want, right?
I think that’s a really good option…
Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
As ranking number three in this office, I am order –
Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.
As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I’m in session. I’ve determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.]
No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee.
Hey. I can’t concentrate when I know you’re in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. [Michael sighs.] C’mon, my treat.
All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
That’s my boy. I know the perfect place, too.
No. Benihana. Much classier. But don’t worry, the babes are totally hot, too. [do a fist bump and explosion]
Ah, I need my entourage [both exit Michael’s office] Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C’mon, we’re going to Asian Hooters.
I’m not feeling so well. I’ve got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan’s forehead]
OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
So she looks really hot, so I said, “You look hotter than usual today.” [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table.
Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um… [to two other people at the table] Sir, I’m going to need take this chair.
Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They’re on a date. They look very happy.
So she looks at me right, and she goes, “I’m sorry, don’t I even know you?” After a year, a
I can’t… I can’t here what you’re saying.
[off screen at other end of table] What’re you talking about?
She would get this little foam mustache…
[still off screen] Carol had a mustache?
And I used to say “Hey, got latte?” And she’d say, that’s not funny.
[off screen] What are you guys talking about?
She totally got me. She understood that we didn’t have to laugh to enjoy —
Michael! Repeat what you said louder!
It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I’m here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight’s face]
I’m already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can’t, OK, I’m gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out…
Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We… I… May day. Haha. Man down over here, [to waitress] we need your help.
I think we’ll start with a round of noga-sakes. [waitress gives confused look]
One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won’t make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.
You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas]
Pam, don’t tell her what to do! Phyllis.
I think I’ll go to Angela’s party, because that’s the party I know.
I miss the days when there was only one party I didn’t want to go to.
If you’re using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you’re doing it wrong.
OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.
OK. Are you sure I can’t use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?
[Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I’ll see you guys later. [leaves room]
Looks like you’ve got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.
Actually, the Usuba’s the better knife when you’re working with this quantity.
Nah, I don’t know… Still think Nakiri’s better.
I think he’d know. [Dwight and her stare at each other]
Nothing he’s doing is cheering me up.
Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn’t do that to him, would you?
Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. [Cindy laughs and walks away]
You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. [referring to what chef is doing] Watch, watch, watch, watch. [Onions smoke up] Heh, heh? What did I tell ‘ya?
Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So… you can come by… .
[on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?
Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention]
This drink… [in audible conversation with Michael]
I don’t know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.
Did Michael give you permission to do this?
[Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]
Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.]
[Stanley gets up and walks towards the break room.] All right Stanley. Woo.
Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.]
Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.
I said you wouldn’t be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.]
Meredith, if you don’t come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.]
I hear Angela’s party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge… Angela… double fudge… Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm…
Brownies. Cupcakes. [Kevin walks toward conference room]
Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don’t think we’re taking this far enough. [Pam and Karen look at each other] What?
I don’t back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven’t talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don’t even remember. So… yeah. I’m pretty good.
Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. [points to chef] Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. [leans over to neighboring man’s plate] I see steak.
Excuse me [tries to take away meat with chopsticks] Ah, un guard. [Fights with chopsticks and laughs] Family style.
I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. [Cindy laughs] C’mon, do it for Michael. He’s had a really long day.
[laughing] I don’t know what he’s doing.
Now open your eyes and describe it to me.
I… don’t know, it has four bed rooms and a loft…
And she’s trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she’s having trouble coming up with it.
Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm… OK, it’s pretty much the same thing.
What d’ya think? [to Stanley about his drink]
See, I told you. You want one Meredith?
Looks like they forgot the power cord.
Oh, you guys, guys, um… I’m sorry, but there’s a problem with the karaoke machine. [everyone sighs]
Hang on little ladies. You don’t need this thing, I’ll go grab my synthesizer. [Everyone cheers]
Darryl! Darryl! Darryl! [Darryl exits break room and passes Phyllis]
Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your… [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We’re having a party.
[tries to break nut on a Nutcracker doll] These nuts are really hard to crack.
Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone’s had some.
You’ve got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
Maybe that’ll help. Is it cold in there?
[referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!
We should invite them to the Christmas party.
Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.
Oh, you are such mench my friend. [They stand up and do fist bump and explosion]
OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. [Guys walk in with two different waitresses from Benihana’s]
I’m sure they’ll want to meet her, too.
The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.
Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it’s yours.
Thanks! I, I wanna give you something.
Oh. [She whispers in his ear. Michael starts to laugh] That’s what she said.
Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
Is he the hot one or the giant baby?
[whispers] The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.
[under her breath] There’s another party in the break room.
Oh, party in the break room! Let’s go, let’s go! Thank God! Let’s go to the break room.
Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you’re going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table]
You can’t have it [takes back toy] I don’t walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
Hey! It’s Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!
[singing] I want you to know. That I’m happy for you. I wish nothing but…
Do you agree about what? [laughs] Wow. You’re  lucky you’re so darn cute.
[singing] And I’m here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It’s not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.
No. It was awful. I couldn’t hear anything. [cheers from other party]
I’ve had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela’s hand]
[Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift]
Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices]
Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We’re gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.
[holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
Angela, we’ve been hearing really great thing about uh… your brownies and we were hoping you’d consider merging into two parties.
I’m not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
Yeah, but we don’t have a power cord.
Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?
Something ’bout the way your hair falls in your face…
[singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together… Ryan…
Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.
Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses]
It’s… it’s one of those two. [points at both]
Yeah… well, it’s been hard, they’re wearing the exact same uniform. And I’ve been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.
I honestly don’t see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn’t love his wife just because he’s not sure what she looks like?
Hey. Where’s my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don’t know where she is. ‘Cause I’m drunk, I can’t even find her.
Haha, I do! I just haven’t hugged you in awhile [marks Cindy’s arm with a black marker]
Oh, good. That felt good. Let’s go. Party.
[singing] Spinnin’ n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don’t touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I’m crazy about ‘ya…
[into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?
[into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What’s your twenty?
No way. [both hold up Bridget Jones’ Diary movie DVD]
What a horrible, horrible movie that was.
And now we get to remember it forever.
Hey. This party blows, so we’re gonna leave.
No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and…
I… you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.
No… I have school. [leaves with other waitress and bicycle]
[singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed…
Well, for starters, I’ve known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.
Don’t make fun… You’re making fun of me.
I guess, I didn’t know her very well. I marked her arm.
I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don’t… I know, I know. I can’t believe I gave her my bike!
Yeah. Which, don’t get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it’s over, you’re left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn’t score and I’m not sure who’s actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn’t matter. It’s all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.
[singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That’s fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..
[on phone] Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There’s this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won’t be disappointed. Umm, It’s all-inclusive…
[singing] … Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door]
Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out]
[singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
[singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.
Hmm… Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
[Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] “You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.” Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away]
William Randolph Shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays, and I’m paraphrasing here, “Love doth be poison.” Brilliant. And a lot of people don’t give Shakespeare enough credit. They think it was somebody else. A-holes.
We didn’t have a party planning committee in Stamford. Somebody would just volunteer to run out to Carvel and pick up an ice cream cake. So the fact that they have a committee here, fascinating.
This is ridiculous. I… I’ve spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party… Are you even listening to me?
I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear?
[sighing] Look, it’s a free country. If she wants to throw a party…
[Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it.
I’m sorry. It wasn’t my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that’s going on right in front of your face.
That really hurt. I’m writing you up. [Angela makes an angry face] Hey, you are not allowed to touch other employees. Am I being clear?
Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic.
I don’t care which party I go to. Once you’ve danced naked at a hash bonfire with the spirits of the dead, all parties seem pretty much the same.
I think I’ll go to Angela’s party, because that’s the party I know.
Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?
It’s like you weren’t even at the meeting.
I’m going to the party in the break room, because they have more chairs in there. If I have to stand around a long time, I get real unpleasant to be around.
[Phyllis puts down phone] Hmm hmm. [Phyllis gets up and goes to Angela’s party]
No, no, no, no. You know what, I better hold off. I wanna make sure I don’t dial Carol before I get drunk.
So, really, you’re just calling her?
Yeah. You know what? I am. I’m gonna call her. That’s a good idea.
[from across the table] Where’s Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?
[on [phone] No, I don’t think I’m asking too much. I think it’s only fair that you tell me exactly what I did wrong. Okay. Uh huh. Well that… yeah. Uh huh. All right. Well, could you tell me something that I did
Merry Christmas. [hands over a gift]
Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?
Okay, we’re never technically… um is there.. Is there a problem?
Well, I didn’t get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I’m not gonna stand for that anymore.
Um That’s… That’s fair. I’m sorry. Merry Christmas. [Ryan starts walking away.]
There’s no fizz in this punch. Phyllis!
No, I’ve got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand.
[talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.
[from inside dumpster] No, you paid money for that CD.
I’m serious. It’ll show that we don’t care about material things.
[starts to cry] You don’t have to scream at me.
Are you having fun in this relationship?
I don’t know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think…
[crying] Don’t dump me while I’m in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you’re so cold. I’ll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks]
[both inside dumpster] Did you look over here?
And what are these? Are… Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren’t you supposed to eat the yolks?
Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He’s so weird.
No, you’re perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it?
He is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him.
Oh, you’re gonna face far greater problems than I can possibly help you with.
For recording. Michael is on vacation and he’s asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it’s the six month commitment.
Oh my God, Dwight, what’re you doing?
You’re not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that’s making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He’s got a knife!
No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley’s neck?!
[leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
[picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby’s bonnet.
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly…
Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.
Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?
Oh my God, Karen, you’re right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
You can’t see… You can’t see my stomach.
I am now chopping off Phyllis’ head with a chainsaw! … Rin-in-in-in-in-in!
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
Just relax, OK? I’ll get to all of it later.
Aren’t you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.
Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.
My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.
Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I’m gonna…
I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers… mon.
Feelin’ hot, hot, hot! [playing conch shell] Feelin’ hot, hot, hot! Feelin’ hot, hot, hot! Feelin’ hot, hot, hot! That’s all I know so far, but I’m gonna keep practicing.
That’s good. [Michael continues to play conch shell]
You know, I had never been out of the country before now?
Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.
It’s kind of an impoverished country.
Yeah… Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
But you can’t today, we’re doing inventory.
We couldn’t do it without you, so we postponed.
I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.
Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don’t make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?
Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.
By the end of the day? That’s impossible.
The Jamaicans don’t have a word for “impossible.”
Yep, it’s English, it’s “impossible.”
Michael, there’s no way we can do it in time.
How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That’s all you need.
Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor]
No, no, no. No, that’s a German woman named Urkel Grue.
[on phone] Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.
Big whoop! I was in Hot-lanta. That whole town is whacked.
Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.
You took the ice queen? I don’t buy it.
Well I’m looking at a photo, right now. And I’m telling ‘ya, could be in Maxim.
They wouldn’t give you a subscription to Maxim.
OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?
OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at… [reading computer screen]
Wait, I just got it from somebody else. Wow. This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture?
That’s great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?
OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not “packaging.” Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?
OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.
Mike, I’m very busy down here. [eats chicken]
Yeah. Yes. Um, I’m just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
I have a special assignment for you.
A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is “Jamaican Jan Sun Princess.”
Unless you’re willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
So, I dunno, I just feel likes we’ve been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?
Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.
No, I didn’t mind helping Jim with his problem. That’s what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.
Oh, don’t worry about it. I mean, it’s better than listening to Michael play a conch shell… which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!
Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]
Hey I need to talk to you right now.
Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you’ve entered into an intimate relationship.
That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.
Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife… we don’t talk now.
This is probably the icebreaker you need.
You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.
I bet you would love all the details, wouldn’t you? Skeevy little perv.
All right, if you’re having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.
No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?
OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you’re not helping.
I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it’s Jan on the phone for you.
Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I’m not here. Tell… tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.
[to Jim and Ryan] Michael hit a deer?
Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael’s office] There’s an emergency in the warehouse.
[starts clapping] Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.
All right. [continued clapping and cheering for Michael]
That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!
Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman—
No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe…
My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let’s be professional, all right?
Feelin’… feelin’ hot, hot, hot! [plays conch shell]
Jan called. She’s coming in later to talk to you.
Ole ole – ole ole… Ole ole – ole ole. People in the party – hot hot hot [playing conch shell]
Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]
I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
For talking sense into Halpert. The Day’s Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing.
Oh, yeah, no. Don’t worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.
Oh, yes! Yes! What’d I tell you? I knew he’d turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he?
[takes off coat to tie around waist] It’s hot in here.
[Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don’t need to stay here.
I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you’re PMSing pretty bad, huh?
I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister.
Very sunny. Family’s important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.
I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means… lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.
This is the kind of thing, you know? I am… attracted to you. I, I don’t know why, I… but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that’s what Dr. Perry thinks.
This is the point, OK? You’re wrong for me. In… In… every way. But I still find myself wanting to… be with you.
And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.
So, umm… thanks for coming by. So, I, uh…
Well, good, OK. Thank you… for taking the time…
Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate – [Jan leans over and kisses Michael passionately]
Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.
Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico?
I was definitely right. [both laugh] Oh, brother.
What am I going to do? [Refers to large pictures of Jan and Michael] I’m gonna hang it up at home. I don’t have a lot of art. [smirks]
I just had the best, most romantic week of my life in Sandals, Jamaica. Went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive. And then I flew back to Scranton, and then they lost one of my bags.
Yeah, mon. Me just got back to the office.
While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.
I just got back from vacation, mon, all right? So chill. Let’s don’t… Don’t harsh my mellow, mon.
I took a vacation once. Never again. While I was away, Jim had my desk shipped to me in Roswell.
Presents. I got presents for everybody. Dwight, a genuine Rastafarian wig.
Andy, I got you a genuine Jamaican T-shirt. They love Milli Vanilli down there.
You are so welcome, mon. Angela, you just got leied. [puts lei on Angela]
Yes, you did. Okay. Oh, Pam, I forgot to get you something.
I’m just kidding. Coconuts for your coconuts!
Go ahead. Let me know if I miscalculated the size. I don’t think I did.
Stanley, I got you some ganja. I’m just kidding. It’s coffee. I bet you wish it was ganja.
I just got back from vacay. Come on. Give me a break, man. [holds up CD] Waves over Jamaica, $6.99.
Did he actually give you some ganja?
But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that’s fun.
I would love to take them all to Jamaica, but is that good management? Yes. But is it the best management? Well, I can’t afford it, and corporate won’t pay for it. So who’s the real criminal?
How many of you know the meaning of the Jamaican term, Hakuna Matata?
Is that not what happens when you’re high?
You look like you have the munchies.
I have the munchies. I’m gonna get some of those chocolate wafers.
Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes.
I don’t know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael’s way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt. [holds up picture with Michael and himself in Egypt]
Where did you save the list of exchanges?
I will gladly give you that information when my bonus comes through.
But I won’t be able to do inventory without it.
Then you won’t be able to do inventory.
Yeah, I really like Stanley, but I’m not always sure if he likes me. I guess that’s okay, ’cause I don’t really like him.
Okay. Well, Jan’s email password is not Dunder Mifflin, Sandals, Jamaica, Michael, Michael Scott, Jan Scott, or Mrs. Jan Scott.
Her passwords aren’t going to be Dwight, Dwight. That’s stupid. Okay.
So your trip to Scottsdale was good?
Oh yeah, Arizona’s beautiful. Yeah. It’s great to… great to see my sister.
Oh, yeah, I know. I don’t… I don’t normally lay out in the sun a lot, but, you know, when it’s Scottsdale… I was visiting my sister and…
When a woman gets older, she’ll go just about anywhere with just about anyone. I’ve done some things I’m not so proud of, but I’ve seen the world.
Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can’t just whore it out.
I should be turned on. But, last year, remember, I had that skin cancer scare, and so now all I can think is that I hope she was wearing sunscreen. God, I would love to rub some on her.
The worst part about the Internet, when a secret is out, everyone knows. The best part about the Internet, that video of the dancing Indian midget, crossbow.org, massively multiplayer online gaming, i.e. Everquest. I also enjoy online banking.
Okay. So I went on the Internet, and she is not gonna find another apartment for that price. I mean this one is twice as much, and it doesn’t have parking. Does she like to park?
Okay. This one is the same price but it’s got…
Yes, it is The Island Luau Inventory ’07. It’s actually a success compared to Disco Audit ’05.
We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we’re supposed to.
Let me see this. [scans one box seven times] Looks good to me.
I wouldn’t have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don’t wanna miss the show.
[Kelly singing] Hey! Hey! Stop your mouth, please.
Eighty-six. Eighty-seven. [singing] Eighty-eight. Eighty-nine.
Hey Dwight, I bet I can stack faster than you can.
Oh, yeah? Prove it, champ. You ready?
[Dwight and Andy stacking boxes rapidly] Nice.
Those aren’t straight. Totally crooked. Totally crooked. You’re disqualified.
[to herself] Be careful. [yells as boxes fall on her] Hello? I’m stuck!
Hey, Stanley, in case I don’t see you again after tonight, here is your bonus, $1,000 cash. Keep the change. [hands Stanley a piece of Jamaican currency]
It is Jamaican. The exchange rate is 65-to-1. I don’t remember in which direction.
So it’s either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.
You know, I actually lived in Honolulu for a year.
You’re a box short on the black, medium-line ballpoints.
One year, I had a close acquaintance of mine back a truck in here and clean out this whole place. That was a very good year. I think they blamed it on some kid.
Sorry, oh wow, that’s so rude. I’m sorry, I can’t control him.
Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael’s new friend.
Oh well, ‘Yoy’ should bring in ‘Long Tim’ in one day. Shouldn’t he?
You ruined a funny joke, you. Get out of my offive.
That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
… Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It’s like we are touring Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.
Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam’s desk]
Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
Thank you. [Puts candy back] I… I don’t want those.
Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.
Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?
Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.
Hmmm, well… let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don’t know. Michael Scott.
Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.
Well, it is very gracious of you to accept.
Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.
We’re the same age and I’ll pick… Karen.
Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.
You can’t pass. You’ve got to pick somebody.
I am very flattered. I was his second choice after “Pass.”
Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?
Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a… motor… carriage.
Wait, “Amazing Race” like, the biggest sale wins?
No, we’re just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.
It’s just… brrrrrr… It’s “Amazing Race,” Phyllis. Okay? We’re in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let’s do it.
Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis’ keys under the car.]
Seriously? You’re going to sit in the back?
Uh, yeah. It’s the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.
In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here’s the good news. Every success I’ve ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.
What’s the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?
Ugh… that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.
Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.
Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?
Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?
Mind? Nothing would delight me more.
My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don’t give up easily. I have walked two marathons.
[Walks out of the Ladies’ Restroom] Let’s go. The men’s room was disgusting.
No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.
Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with… [Jim slaps Dwight]
Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.
Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?
Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?
You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.
Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It’s in the Hamptons. My dad’s got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow’s nest. Also shot a deer once.
You know what? Let’s get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.
Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don’t work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It’s in New York.
Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We’ve had some problems in the past.
I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.
I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.
Stop it. [Puts his hand on Andy’s shoulder] Stop it.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?
Oh man. Talk about your classic “Lame dash O.” Do we even want that guy buying our paper?
I… I’m so sorry man. I really screwed that up.
I don’t know. Who knows how words are formed.
Oh, she’s great. This is us last year in Bermuda. Lovely place. You ever been to Bermuda?
So good to see you too. I’d like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.
I’m gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?
Hello, Ryan. What do you have for us?
We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
We have discount prices on ink cartridges…
And, also, any forms that you are going to need…
Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.
I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
Ha ha ha! And you just said, “Hi! Hi! Hi!” Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she’s six months old!
We’ll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys.
Sure, that’s true we can’t compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?
Please keep holding, your call is very important to us.
Erm, that’s one of the ‘Big guys.’ Been on hold this whole time.
[Dials cell Phone] And this is Dunder-Mifflin.
Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly.
Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you … . [Jim hangs up]
Here is my card. It’s got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don’t celebrate any major holidays.
Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.
That’s great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.
I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
Hmm. I don’t think so. But thanks. My building manager… is… You understand.
Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.
I’m so glad you’re with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
You can pay me back later for the makeover.
I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?
Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.
I like Karen. She’s pretty and appears intelligent.
Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
Dwight’s name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don’t know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote “Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.”
No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]
I overslept. Damn rooster didn’t crow.
I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.
Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.
Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.
Don’t. Don’t you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.
How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.
That’s not the worst thing in the world. I’ll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won’t be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.
I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
Well, I don’t have a lot of choices.
Pam? Did I ever have a ‘thing’ for her? No, why? Did she say something?
Yeah. Ok, here’s the … I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn’t feel the same way. So, it didn’t amount to anything, and I left. I’m really glad you’re here. ‘Kay?
Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome.  Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy?  No, he was not.  He was a total douche.  Doompity-doomp.
I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.
Hey man. [Dwight hugs Jim and leaves]
Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy’s such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I’m thrilled. So, it’s pretty… [camera had focused in on Angela watching] Hello? Pretty good.
I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
[in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it’s fine for the time being. Oops. Break’s over.
[to Ryan] Big Turkey. [cellphone plays “Rockin’ Robin”]
All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.
Thank you muchly. [cellphone continues playing]
I called it myself. I just thought you’d get a kick out of the new ring.
Side note. I’d just like to say I’m thrilled to be working directly beneath you.
I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you’re younger and have less experience.  So here’s to the future… Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna…
I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.
Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.
Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman…
What does that even mean? That is impossible.
But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody’s spirits.
Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?
Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.
Noooothin’. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?
Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my “Lost” on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?
Well, I will take that as a maybe. [Michael gets up] Where are you going?
Oh, well, I’m going to the kitchen, I’ll walk with you.
[lurking by the bathroom door] Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin’ a lot of face time with the boss.
Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I’ve thought about certain things. And I’m sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I’ll join. I’d love to. That’s — thank you.
You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work.
[scoffs] Child’s play. Give me something hard to sell.
Wow. [walks over to the plant] What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.
Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
Oh, that wasn’t the night crew. That was Dwight.
Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.
Which is like, “Right on.” And Pam was like “blah blah blah” and you were like “Yeah, psht.” Nailed it.
I really have no preference. We don’t even have to have a party.
No, hey, hey. Don’t be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.
Why don’t you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let’s get him one.
Oh, no, thank you. I’m just looking.
Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. [fake casts off] Whizzzzz. [catches Jim] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. [Jim gets up] Cli — ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!
Encourage him? I’m the victim, okay? He’s fishing for me. We’ve got to do something.
Look, I’ve got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I’m sorry. I can’t.
Who’s that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.
185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! [“displays” Jim who looks thoroughly annoyed]
Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
I liked you better when you were the temp.
Hey guys. How’s the workload on all of Dwight’s old accounts? Handling it okay?
Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?
Don’t – don’t do that. That’s not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.
Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
Really comin’ down out there. Commute’s gonna be hell.
I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
So um, where were you workin’ before this?
[scoffs] Paper company. They’re only one of Staples’ top competitors in the area.
Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?
I don’t like him, his giant head, or his beady little eyes. That’s all I got to say on the matter.
[singing] In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.
Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
Oh, I’m kind of in the middle of — yes please.
[after Jim knocks over his pencils] Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.
[hands Pam Andy’s phone] Are there any messages?
Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?
Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
You know what?  Maybe it’s in the ceiling.
[trying to look in Phyllis’s desk, she slams the drawer shut] I don’t trust you, Phyllis!
I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.
Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.
Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?
Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football – Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we’ll hit the tiz-own.
Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.
No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You’re going to drive me crazy.
[to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It’s your funeral. See how that works out for you.
Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.
Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.
So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.
I don’t want to do your laundry anymore.
We can talk about that. [Dwight high fives Michael] All right.
[inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that’s half-inch drywall.
I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker]
[imitating Andy] “It’s not freakin’ funny!”
Actually, yeah. I didn’t think I would, but turns out — [Angela walks away] it’s great.
Ladies and gentlemen! May I present… Mr. Dwight Schrute!
Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You’re gonna break it. [looks around the room] Not bad, huh?
You did this for me? [camera pans to “Welcome Back Oscar” sign]
Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
So does this remind you of your childhood right now?
It reminds me a lot of the ‘Three Amigos’ with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
Wow. Thank you. Wow, that’s– thanks so much.
[sighs] Do you still have feelings for her?
[long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? [hands broom to Dwight, though Oscar thinks he’s handing it to him]
Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don’t need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]
Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be… Marcy!
That’s right, it’s so good to meet you.
Thanks.  Well, you ready to have some fun?
How, would you stop interrupting please?
Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock.  And when I came to, I had an epiphery.  Life is precious.  And if I die I want my son to know the dealio.  The dealio of life.
Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won’t be able to.
To jump start a car, first pop the hood.  Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine.  Then you take these and clip them wherever.
Number eight, learn how to take off a woman’s bra.
[Dwight is wearing a bra] You just twist your hand until something breaks.
Well you get the picture.  Thanks Pam.
And remember no matter what, I will always love you.
You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
Okay.  From the top.  Ready?  Three-
Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So…
I’m sorry.  I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.
Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only.
I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we’re better than ever.
Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.
Something’s up with Jim and Karen.  Not that I’ve been eavesdropping.  It’s not really any of my business, but I’ve gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim’s neck.
Halpert!  Tall, queer, handsome as ever.  Hey everybody it’s me, Jim.  Hello, hello.  Todd Packer.
Karen Fillipelli.  Jim’s girlfriend.
Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight!
Yes.  Yes!  Oh!  There-oh! [Clutches chest and falls to the floor]
Quick somebody help!  Help the man! [Pretends to kick Michael]
I can’t believe you’re not going to be there.  It’s going to be good, it’s going to be a great bachelor party man.
It’s the only time he can do it.  2:30 to 3:15.  It’s going to be great.  We’re going to be doing some darts, we’re going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie.  Going to be very delicious.
And what kind of stripper did you get?
You didn’t order a stripper?  Have you ever even been to a bachelor party?
Mike, okay, a stripper is bachelor party 101.  If you don’t get a stripper your party is going to suck it hard.
I can’t get a stripper here.  Sexual Harassment.
Just get one for the girls too.  That evens it out.  You know, separate but equal.
Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh! [Spanks himself]
Okay.  Co-ed naked strippers in this office.  For realsies.
Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there’s been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
Never underestimate the power of a good night’s sleep.
When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.
Oh yeah.  Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping.  Better than not.
Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.
Yeah.  Don’t fall asleep at your desk.  [Turning towards the vending machine] Oh my God.
Okay.  We are off.  Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.
Well get on it.  And make it happen.
Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats.  No, TATS.  Of course I want-
Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
Nice.  Do you have any blonde women?
He hasn’t even said a word yet.  Just giggling.
[Pokes Ryan with a sex toy.] Gotcha, oh! [Phone rings.] Yes?
Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
[Spits champagne back into her glass]
Hello ladies.  Who here is a history buff?  Who’s a fan of buff naked?  Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.
Thank you for that introduction, Mr. Scott, and good afternoon fine gentlewomen of Dunder Mifflin.
He’s in his knickers.  Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.
Well, actually, I never was president.
Ah.  I’m here to teach you a little bit about my life and the era of the founding fathers.
And when they came over on the Mayflower.  Bow chicka bow.
Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them.  Especially that one. [Points to Phyllis]
Have you ever seen a stripper before?
Yes.  Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias.  It was one of her many aliases.
I’m Elizabeth, I’m the dancer that was requested.
Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper.
Oh, okay good.  Well in the future please identify yourself as such.
[Reading the text message] Is she hot?  Text back, “Kind of.”
It was a warm June evening in 1752, the night of my fateful kite flight.
But don’t you also have girlfriends in Paris?  Like a lot of them?
Uh, well that is a grey area of my life.  Okay?  So, it was a warm June evening.
Look at that.  Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.
Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth!
Well, that is because I am a renaissance man.
Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?
Well, you’re very saucy!  [Winks at Pam.]
Guys, beef!  It’s what’s for dinner!  Who wants some man meat?
Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.
Well then my man meat, he shall have.  There you go.  Deliciousity.
So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use?
Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
Hey um, I wanted to talk to you.  I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys.
Well that you kissed.  And we talked it through and it’s totally fine, it’s not a big deal.  It’s just a kiss.  Wait- you’re not still interested in him?
Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing.  You should definitely go out with Jim.  I mean, you’re going out with Jim.  I’m not going out with Jim.  You’re dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.
Nothing.  I was just thinking of something else.
Okay.  The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.
I call shuffle.  Here we go.  [Spreads cards out all over the table]
Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here.  Everybody I’d like to introduce you to Elizabeth.
I hear there’s an important meeting here.
I’m not really into strippers.  You know what I find sexy?  Pam’s art.  She’s an artist and I appreciate that.  It’s very moving and sexy.  The art.
Hit it. [Feel Like Makin’ Love plays in background] So where’s the groom?
Absolutely not.  That’s all you.  That’s all you.
Okay.  Alright, I’ll do it.  Yeah.  Lets do it.  Lets do this thing.  Yeah.  What do I?
Not bad! Not bad!  You smell nice.  Like Tide.
You smell like Tide detergent.  Do you use Tide detergent?  Ha ha ha!  I have a girlfriend so…
I bet she’d be jealous. [Rips off shirt]
Elizabeth, I want you to sit here.  When the phone rings, answer it.
You want me to answer phones with my clothes on.
We hired you for three hours work and we’re going to get it.
Well I’m sensing a little electricity right here.
Yes, but I don’t.  My name is Gordon.
On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I’m afraid she’s going to dump me.
You know Michael, I fathered an illegitimate son.
But I kept all this from my wife Deborah.  These things only serve to upset the women.  They are the gentler sex.
Well, Ben Franklin, you’re really kind of a sleezebag.
Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women?  Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?
Secrets, secrets are no fun.  Secrets, secrets hurt someone.
Chocolate!  Where did you acquire it?  That is a delicacy in the Amazon but it has not yet been imported to the United States.
Why the tyrant King George, of course!
I don’t care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin.  I am 99% sure.
[On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay?
Not really, look I don’t know how to say this so I just will.
I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
You went to a bachelor party at work?
Well I don’t even think the stripper was that hot.  Do you guys think she was hot?
Do what?  I just asked you a question.
Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam.
Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I’m glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
Yeah, right.  God, I need a boyfriend.  You know Ryan I’m totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends.  Whenever.
Oh my God, I would get so fat if I worked here.
Yeah?  I lose my appetite all the time.
So you don’t want to end our relationship?
That is so sweet.  You are the best GD girlfriend in the world.  Do you know that?
So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?  Ben Franklin.  And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.  Which rhymed.  Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can’t.
Are you near sighted or far sighted?
Both.  That’s why I invented the bifocal.
In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I’ve been conducting a similar experiment.
[Windows reboot sound] Dwight, want an Altoid?
[Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs]
I don’t know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise]
Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?
Okay, for this next one everyone hop out. Just Phyllis and Dad. Actually, let’s bring Mom back in. And the sisters. And you, and you, and you. Great.
Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.
Phyllis… ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like ‘Wait, thought I called that off’.
You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
Thank you. Don’t linger. Break left. Left!
The Shrutes have their own traditions.   We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.
There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.
Thanks, Michael. That’s sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?
You’re probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It’s okay, if you did. It’s a very natural reaction. It’s your wedding. And you’re nervous…
Okay… umm… I’m sure that Bob… Wow. That is… that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah… Are you set on that hairstyle?
I don’t need your… thank you. No, Michael please… I just need some time alone.
You might be surprised to learn that I’ve only been to one other wedding. It’s actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.
[in video of Michael as a kid] I hate you!
Long story short: Jeff’s dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said ‘boo’.
Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That’s the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.
You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won’t have to get her a gift.
[to Toby’s date] Hi. I’m Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her?
Could you scoot over? You’re on my dress.
I thought you’re not supposed to wear white to a wedding.
[whispers to father] That’s ok. [Albert gets out of his wheelchair and starts walking]
Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now… the wedding has no highlight.
I can’t believe I pushed that… that guy’s lazy ass around all day… until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That’s… well… I got news for you, Albert. If that’s your real name. The show’s not over.
And do you, Phyllis, take Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration, to be your lawfully wedded husband?
Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!
… take Phyllis to be your lawfully wedded wife
Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. [generalized clapping and cheering] Yeah! That’s what I’m talking about!
Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.
Congratulations, Bob. You’re a good man. But just know… if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.
If you ever lay I finger on Phyllis, I’ll kill you.
Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. [to Albert] Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.
Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I’m going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.
Well… this was supposed to be your wedding.
Oh… um… no.  That’s… um… That’s actually fine
There’s no way it’s fine. I’m sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.
Okay, that’s a lot of good ideas. Thanks
‘Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?
The bride and groom? What are their names?
Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let’s move it. Come on. Come on.
Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.
Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?
It’s beautiful. Why don’t you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
I’m already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.
I do. I know a fair amount about fine food… and drink. This is a white.
No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist’s wedding and our guitarist’s wedding.
I know I normally don’t notice these kind of things but uh… This wedding’s really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste.
I know you’re probably not going to remember this, right? But um… Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom.
Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.
I uh guess I wasn’t really too involved in the planning.
You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married.
Phyllis, you’re a wonderful woman. And you’re a hell of a bowler!
The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones.
Phyllis and Bob: their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her… and she’s kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was ‘Easy Rider’. Now as for Bob… Bob Vance…
he works… Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn’t say anything when Phyllis’ dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay.
Give me… Give me the microphone, Michael.
Oh. Yeah. You’re out of here! You’re… Yeah. I hate you!
When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then… No, it’s totally hypothetical.
Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I’m not even going to dance one song.
You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I’m sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
Yeah, that’s weird. I thought they only played the Police.
I know. Uh… I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance?
[sings] ee… I was meant for you… buppity du bom bu.
[to Pam] Hey, want to get out of here?
Here’s a ‘not hypothetical’. I’m really happy I’m with Karen.
[sings] Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every…
One… Two… Three. Ahhhh! [Phyllis throws the flowers, Ryan knocks them out of Kelly’s hands, Toby’s date gets them]
I just want Phyllis to have a great day.
Phyllis and you will be great together.
We are great together. We are a great team.
Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don’t want this to ruin her honeymoon.
Nobody ever helped me. I had to do it myself. Even the doctor didn’t know!
Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.
Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I’m sorry. I just… I just wanted to make this a day to remember.
They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that’s crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.
Be careful. Oh no!! [Phyllis and Bob smear cake on each other’s face] Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me! [Michael smears cake on his own face]
I almost died. I… I went into this skid—
Today’s a special day, because I am being honored as a… visiting… professor, special lecturer, emeritus… how did you, how did you…
You will be a guest speaker… in my Emerging Enterprises class.
In business school, Kevin. Business school.
If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So… I’d be stupid
Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our… A game. What was the most inspiring thing I’ve ever said to you?
“Don’t be an idiot.” Changed my life.
Whenever I’m about to do something, I think, “Would an idiot do that?” And if they would, I do not do that thing.
Will they throw their hats, you think?
A lot of times, at a… school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
Y-You understand nobody’s graduating.
Yeah, I know, I know. I’m just saying if they did throw their hats I’ve got a great line for that: “May your hats fly as high as your dreams.” … That was a pretty good line.
I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you’re such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey!
Okay, just so you know, it’s just the students from my class in a little studio.
I’m really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. … Is that braggy? I don’t mean it to be braggy.
Pam’s with Roy. I’m with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin’ on.
I can’t believe you’re back together with Roy!
Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.
Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.
I mean, it’s not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.
…Oh… yeah. Definitely… I’ll be there. For sure.
Campus. Brings back so many memories. … That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? [runs over, throws frisbee] Whoo!
…Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk]
Solving a mystery, if that’s quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo–BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
[on ground] … Please don’t let that stupid thing near me…
Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
…Dunder-Mifflin can’t compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off…
I can’t hear what he’s saying, but he looks like he’s really into it.
The simple solution would be to open a window… if we had… windows that could open.
Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!
Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.
At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
I’m sorry what did you say? So wierd…
The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There’s no mark. I feel so… tingly… so strangely powerful… [shrugs] Oh well.
And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It’s white hot.
What? … No. It burned me. I… bizarre.
If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a “sylvania.” Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn’t mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
Oh, this looks great. I’d, I’d love to be there, but my daughter’s play is tonight. … Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.
Well, it’s important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.
Okay, I’m seeing some confused… faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
Well… okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.
Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?
We can’t overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. [everyone types on their laptops]
Hey Jim, here’s the aspirin you wanted.
Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
The glare off Angela’s crucifix? It’s blinding.
I don’t have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor’s dog.
Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance–
Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain?
…I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you’ll come back.
…We don’t want them back, ’cause they’re… stupid.
How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger?
Nice try, how’s your Pollack-says-what index?
Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
By your own employee’s calculation you’ll be obsolete in the next five to ten years.
What are you doing? You’d better not hurt that little bat.
Don’t hurt that bat, Creed! It’s a living thing with feelings and a family!
Flush him towards the door. On my go… NOW!
[locks bat in break room] I… am a hero!
Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.
But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain?
But there’s five Goliaths, there’s… Staples, Officemax…
Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators… mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we’re learning in business school?
Business is always personal. It’s the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
So… you’re cool to just wait here for animal control?
Animal control? I’ve been controlling animals since I was six.
Cool. Okay. I’m gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades… there’s just so much sun in here… bye Dwight.
Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.
I still need… you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you?
Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh?
How ’bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That’s… pretty cool, huh?
Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith’s head]
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
…[captures bat in bag] … You’re welcome.
It’s cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.
Yeah, I’ll just, I’ll drive myself home.
Your art.. was the prettiest art of… all art.
Look, I’m sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and… of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don’t have to fire me.
Fire you? No, no no. You are moving… to the annex.
A good manager doesn’t fire people. He hires people and inspires people. … People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
You’re the one who said we needed more culture.
Yeah, on Van Gogh’s first try, he drew the hands of the peasants.
Meaning, real art takes courage, okay? And honesty.
Well, those aren’t Pam’s strong points.
Yeah, exactly. That’s why this is… motel art.
Pam-casso! Sorry I’m late, I had to race across town.
My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. [sighs] … How much?
Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there’s my… window, and there’s my car! That your car?
That is our building… and we sell paper. … I am really proud of you.
Do you have something in your pocket?
It is… a message. It is an inspiration, it is… a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God…
It’s only temporary, okay? Don’t get excited.
I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t…
Well ultimately I went into business to inspire people. They say those who can’t do, teach. I can do both. I teach doing.
OK, here we go… Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.
Wow! That’s a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these.
Those are the books that sum up the other books.
Oh, umm, ever since I started here, I’ve kept a diary of all my sales.
No, it’s just mileage mostly, but there’s one chapter that I call wisdoms. I’m going to read you a series of statements, and I want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.
Just getting warmed up. Mistakes are just successes that you mess up.
This… You know this is a scale of one to ten?
She’s on her honeymoon. She won’t be back for six weeks.
Here’s a joke for you. Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis’s wedding?
You know I don’t like to participate in the…
Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis’s wedding?
Really, it’s just that I don’t like to participate…
It’s just… I’m sorry… It’s gossip, and I don’t think it’s healthy.
Well, I’m not going to get over myself… it’s wrong.
Because Roy use to… [long censor beep]… with the rice… [long censor beep]… [laughs]
Everybody please stand, and get up on your desks. [goes to stand on desk] Just stand right up.
That’s, yep a little flimsy. Umm… OK… Ahh… Alright, no more desks. Oh OK.
I have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow. Simple… [holds up snickers] Kids love candy bars.
How have you adopted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?
Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise…ses. Umm, let me ask you this:
Just following up on that first question…
No no no no no. Never follow, always lead.
Bop bop de Bope bop bop bop bop bop. You only have me for a limited time… Yes.
Do you believe your high fixed cost are warranted given your diminishing market share.
How can I put this? That question makes you sound gay.
[Karen sees Pam’s art show flyer on the cabinet door, she looks around to make sure no one is looking, then proceeds to rip in down, Oscar comes out of the bathroom, Karen acts like she was just looking at it and then walks out of the kitchen]
[comes out of the bathroom… screams… runs back into the bathroom]
What is a leader? I asked Jim that, and he said he had never heard the word before. In America, in 2007. He said he knew the word ladder… What an ignoramous.
[Bat hanging from ceiling cleaning itself] I really want to come out.
[looking with Kevin at the art show flyer] Should be fun.
Just goes to show the power of prayer.
So cool you’re back with Roy. Maybe we can rent that cabin on the lake again this summer.
There’ll be two of you and only one of me this time, since Denise left me. So I think it’s fair I only pay a third.
A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that’s why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It’s um, it’s really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.
MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic… And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. [Kevin giggles] Can he do it? I don’t see how he can.
I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!
Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can’t get out, you don’t want anyone to help you?
So we shouldn’t help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?
No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let’s just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. [Michael spits out key, Jim covers it with his foot.]
I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician’s code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key…
Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.
Another worm? Like, are they friends?
Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great.
Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
Why don’t I wanna go? Didn’t expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don’t know any of these people. It’s an obligation. I don’t like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
Oh, sure. Really didn’t give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? [phone rings] Heh-woh you.
I am on my way. I should be there in about 15…
Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
No problem. [doesn’t turn off speakerphone]
…and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I…
Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard’s for happy hour. You should come.
I can’t. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski’s and kinda took a bath, so… we’re going to go get hammered.
Ok, well, we’re going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I’m serious! If you’re going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.
I have decided that I’m going to be more honest. I’m going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol’ Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don’t call me Pammy.
You dressed exactly like the servants.
Wait. I don’t think yours will fit me.
I don’t care. Oh, wow. Here. Don’t put my jacket. Don’t give me that.
That would have been really embarrassing.
Actually, it’s polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.
Wonderful, let’s, ah, see where we can put this. Ok.
Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
It’s been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.
Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?
It’s complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
You said it was important, so… How’s it going?
Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis.
Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That’s feces.
What are you looking for? You bring dip?
Awesome. I’m going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.
You realize this is a legal document that says you can’t sue the company.
I’ve never told you that I love you.
You don’t have to, Jan. This contract says it all.
I am taking a calculated risk. What’s the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
Why is this so hard? That’s what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.
Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?
Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything.  Actually looks bigger with people in it. It’s weird. So…
Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?
Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
[looks at beers] Oh. [Starts to walk away, turns around] No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.
It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.
I’m the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
Yeah, but you’re great now, right? We’re all great. Aren’t we great?
We’re good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
Dwight, wow. That’s not appropriate.
David, how much did this house cost?
These old colonials are great, when they’re sound. I’d love to take a look around.
Cool, let’s start with the banisters.
Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?
That’s Drake. And just so you know, I don’t want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.
Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.
This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.
Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. [takes sip, coughs violently]
One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here.
No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly’s hands]
[tapping Meredith and Kelly’s hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
[points at one of Stanley’s hands and one of Pam’s] Not here. Not here. It’s either here or here. [Stares at Pam] Not here. [Points at Stanley’s hand].
I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff’s station.
Huh. [Bangs on wall] Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What’s in here? [Opens door].
[phone rings] Oh. I must get that. You’ll have to excuse me.
Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
Well, if you’re wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it’s because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated.
Really? I thought it was so obvious. I’m glad it didn’t make you uncomfortable.
No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.
You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.
I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
Oh yeah, they don’t allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis… there. But it’s fun. It’s an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
I’m sorry. You’re just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
Ok. Excuse me. What’s going on? What is it?
Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]
Yes, but you could tell me. What… What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.
Come on, let’s go back to the party.
Don’t take that dress. Stop it, Jan.
No, no, no, means please don’t. Please.
Slam me up against the wall, right here.
I’m not going to slam you up against the wall.
Oh, I’m acting inappropriate? Get out.
Here. [hands Pam a duck stuffed animal]
Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.
Oh good, you’re up. Hey, who makes this chair?
I don’t know, it was here when I was born.
I want one. It’s got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes.
You stay here and have fun, because I’m going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
Ok. Oh, um, don’t mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me.
Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me.
Of course not. I mean, you’re kind of like, my first.
Did you get a chance to try Michael’s homemade potato salad?
Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It’s funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It’s just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.
What’s ah, what’s with Jan and Michael?
I don’t know. Where to begin? My ball.
The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can’t be any secrets between us.
I didn’t do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn’t at all.
Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.
No, I am listening! That’s the problem I am listening!
Yeah, you’re right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!
Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle…
You didn’t have any of the potato salad did you?
No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
Well, if that’s the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
I’m not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don’t you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
Tired. I’m tired. And I didn’t eat enough. And, and, that’s all. That was it.
That’s all. I didn’t mean it. That’s all. I’m just saying I didn’t mean it.
Don’t break up you guys, you’re great together.
I think it’s great that Jim’s invited. It’s important to have contact with the New York execs, or they’ll think everyone here is like Mi…chael.
[Points to Pam’s painting of the building] [laughs] You gotta sign that.
No you gotta put your name in the corner.  I’ve seen that artist do that.  Its good too, cause like you can know who paints what, you know.
Hey, are you going to Poor Richard’s?
I’m going and so are both of you.  We’re all going.
Hey, isn’t there some rule against inter-office dating?
[whispering] I am not doing your dirty work for you.
Ok, so promise that you’ll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.
Oscar, Angela?  I didn’t think you guys would come.
Hey folks, what can I get you?  Oh, hey Meredith.
Yeah.  Jack, these are my co-workers.
[pointing to each correct person] Ryan, Pam, Stanley, Kelly, Kevin, Creed. How’d I do?
This place is disgusting. [They smile at each other]
Why would the architect design stairs this wide?  Was there an obese family in here before you?
I don’t know that.  I’m sure the architect passed away many years ago.
How are you doing?  I’ve, I’ve missed you.
Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint.  Um, did you meet me at the gym?
[still at the table] Who the hell is Ryan talking to?
[at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin.
[at the table] Oh, not again.  Melissa!
Wait for my outside.  [To Ryan] She is sixteen years old.  What is wrong with you?
Okay, okay.  Stanley, let me explain to you what happened.
She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.
No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy.  I’ll snatch your spine out your back.
Space shuttle. Which one?  Oh, Atlantis.  Good thing it’s not the Discovery.  You play soccer?
Oh my God, you’re like, agoraphobic.
Yeah!  You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.
Bye.  Ok, so this is what’s gonna happen.  You’re gonna suck it up.
And then we’re gonna go to the movies.
Roy don’t! [Dwight pepper-sprays Roy]
No need for consternation, everything is under control.
Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.
Ok, what… what is the situation Toby?
Well, we fired Roy, obviously.  And Jim won’t press charges against Roy or the company.
Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his…
No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he’s just using this Roy thing as leverage.
All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
What did I tell you about “yeppers?”
I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?
I really don’t want to talk about it.  I don’t mean to be rude, but I just… I don’t want to comment on what happened.  It
I guess… all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you… for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.
Don’t want it.  Won’t open it.  Don’t need it.  Won’t take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.
Angela, Roy’s check.  He’s coming in later to pick it up.
Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.
Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.
Wikipedia… is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I’ve been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
Hmm, well that’s interesting Darryl.  I think… [mumbling softly] that maybe you should… [mumbling jibberish]
What I’m saying is that, [continues to mumble jibberish]
By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.
Walking out of the room unexpectedly.
[gets up and begins to walk out of the room]
[softly] Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.
I didn’t say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
Oh it… sounded interesting… what you were gonna…
I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.  His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.  Perp grabbed the victim.  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.
Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator’s eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end.
That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
I can’t imagine what I would have done.
I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer’s in your apartment in the middle of the night…
…you can just call somebody else ’cause I’m not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I’m not.
There’s a bunch of people back here, maybe…
Well, don’t talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night…
I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
I don’t think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.  But, if he did intend that?  Wow.  Genius.
Yes, yeah, absolutely.  Have a seat.
You know what?  Actually, let’s go into the conference room.
No, you know what?  Let’s stay here.  No let’s go… Yeah let’s go to the conference room.
Tactic number six.  Change the location of the meeting at the last second.  Totally throws ’em off.
Number 14, declining to speak first.  Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
[long pause] I am declining to speak first.
Okay, I’ll start.  It’s pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I’m scheduled to get one in six months, but I’d like that to be moved up to now.
Hmm.  Ohh, Darryl.  You are a good worker, and a good man.  I just, you know, times are tight.  And I just don’t think corporate is going to go for this right now.
Are you wearin’ lady clothes?  Those look like lady… pants.
[Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman’s clothes.  I would not make that mistake again.
Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman’s suit?
No, I do, I, I wear men’s suits, OK?  I got this out of a bin.
There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one.  And it fit!  So I don’t think that this is totally just a woman’s suit.  At the very least it’s bisexual.
Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious.  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side… that’s the mystery.
Look, it’s got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
It’s European, OK?  It’s a European cut.
Michael, the pants don’t have any pockets.
No, they don’t.  See?  [Michael lifts his jacket tail, sticks out his back side and shows Pam]
It’s been a really rough couple of days… This helps a little.
Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?
No, I don’t want to do that because I’m twice your size anyway.
Um, let’s just do this in 15 minutes.
Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.
Negotiations are all about controlling things.  About being in the driver’s seat.  And make one tiny mistake, you’re dead.  I made one tiny mistake.  I wore woman’s clothes.
Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend’s ass over another woman?
You must have been scared out of your mind.
Well, you know it happened so fast I didn’t really have time to be scared.
What happened, exactly?  I wasn’t here, so I haven’t really heard the whole story.
Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.
And he’s a big dude, you know?  And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.
When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings.  Roy just attacked him.  I’m not sure which one Jim hated more.
Let’s get down to business.  Why don’t you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
[mumbling softly] That was a very good point.
[mumbling softly] You make a very compelling argument.
He could have broken your nose or something.  Crazy.  It’s just so stupid.  I mean, getting back with Roy and everything.  I mean, what was I thinking, right?
No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
Not anymore.  It’s, um… It’s completely over now.
We’ll see.  I’m sure you guys will… find you way back to one another someday.
I am going to give you a piece of paper.  I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.
Because, that is the way these things are done.  In… films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide— slide it, yes.
I am serious, Mike.  That’s a 10% raise.  That’s what I want.
I… I can’t give you that, I— I don’t make this much.
I don’t.  Want me to prove it to you?  There is… a pay stub.
[laughs] Are you serious?  You’re earning this?
Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]
Oh, I’m sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]
A boss’s salary isn’t just about money, it is about perks.  It… for example, every year I get a $100 gas card… Can’t put a price tag on that.
Ok, if you don’t want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
No.  And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what’s your angle?
It’s like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he’s like an eel.  I just can’t grab onto him.  It’s infuriating.
Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.
Well… yes, that’s probably what it is.  So what do I do?
Hmm…  I don’t know.  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.
Michael, here’s the, uh, $15 I owe you.
Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So…
Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he’s way overpaid.
[on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up]
Okay.  Okay, here’s the straight… dope.  No tricks.  No Wikipedia.
I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
That’s ’cause of you, Mike.  They’re not gonna give the workin’ man more than the boss.
Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
I’m not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.  That is ridiculous.
Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
Yeah that’s true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
Why don’t we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
No, Jan.  I’ve never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today.
Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
Yshhyah.  Um, yeah.  I’ll leave right away.
Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our… you know, situation, we’re gonna need to have a third party present.
No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
[talking over Jan] No, Toby is terrible.  Toby is the worst human being I’ve ever known.
…and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don’t do it.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.
Where?  I’m gonna smack you in the head with a hammer.  Come on, let’s go.
What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
[imitating Chris Tucker] Don’t ever touch a black man’s radio!  …Chris Tucker.
I haven’t been to New York in a long time.
Maybe I’ll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.
Oh you could stay too.  He’s got a big place.
Busses, though.  They get you home quick.
And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like “No!”
Then what’d he do? [Kelly’s phone rings]
Okay, bring it home now.  And don’t forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
Yes sir.  Remember that.  I’ll be right outside if you need me
Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I… just can’t help myself.
[to Jim] Hey man, uh… I’m sorry. [Jim motions “Don’t worry about it”] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or… something?
Please.  I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly]
[as Roy is walking out] Jim— Roy— Look out!
Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay.
Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First— [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?
Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
Six percent?  After all we’ve been through?
No.  You gonna play it like this?  You give me a good raise, or no more sex. [Toby begins to write] [to Toby] What are you writing, perv-ball?
This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior.  It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.
I’m so sorry, Pammy.  I really wasn’t gonna do anything.  But then I… kept thinkin’ about you two together, and…  I just thought you guys were really good friends, or… or maybe he was gay or somethin’… Not that that’s wrong.
I’m sorry too.  I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.
So you gonna start datin’ Halpert then?
Oh yeah… Wait a minute, you… broke off our wedding for the guy.
But you’re not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don’t get you Pam.
Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department.  “Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man.  Dwight K. Schrute”
Wow.  I guess word got around.  That’s a nice… honor.
Please.  They hand these out to little kids.  Look.  There’s a teddy bear in a policeman’s cap.
[under his breath] Didn’t think you’d notice…
Why don’t you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.  This is me, Jan.  This is me!
Okay, Michael.  Please, why don’t we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.
Okay, no, no, no, no.  You do not try tactic number eight on me.  I invented tactic number eight.  I’m not going anywhere.
Ohh.  It was a weird day.  I accidentally cross-dressed.  And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.  And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby.  And then, your assistant, is all young and hot.  And I—
Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
Well that’s ridiculous I’m not gonna make—
No, just… I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?
Ah, so…  All right, Levinson.  Here’s the rub.  I would like a 15% raise.
Negotiation is an art.  Back and forth.  Give and take.  And today, both Darryl and I took something.  Higher salaries.  Win win win.  But you know, life is about more… than just salaries.  It’s about perks.  Like having sex with Jan–
So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
Dwight.  Dwight.  I’ve been doing some very interesting reading.
Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could… read it together.
Sounds… fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees]
[scoffs] I… will never say a word.  And now, we are even.
Hey guys!  Guess who’s back! [Dwight pepper-spray’s Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD!
I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know who’s a real hero?  Hiro, from
Apology not… accepted.  Because it wasn’t even necessary in the first place. [laughs]
Cool.  I can’t control what you do.  I can only control what
Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight.  How’s it goin’ man?
Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
Dwight says that he actually doesn’t know one single fact about bear attacks.
Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!
[half-heartedly] Andy!  Nah, that’s too far.
Today is Safety Training Day.  Toby is leading ours upstairs.  Yeauck.  But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.  We are going to listen in on Darryl’s presentation to the warehouse.  And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.
Now, this is the forklift.  You need— [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
You’re not allowed to drive the forklift.
It’s not safe, you don’t have a license.
Guys, I’m not the only one who’s driven the forklift.  [points] Pudge has driven the forklift.
Her.  Yes, “her” is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
[barely keeping his composure] “Hey Darryl, how’s it hangin’?!” [laughs]
And I fell and busted my ankle.  I’m legitimately scared for my workers.
The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
Dammit, Michael.  Pay attention, man.
Anybody wanna take a guess?  Anybody?
Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
[in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful…
No, don’t worry about it.  We’ll just got double or nothin’.
I don’t know, we’ll figure somethin’ out.
These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
Yes, yes.  But it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world… if somebody…
It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
It’s not a trash compactor!  It’s a baler!
Okay, okay!  I got it.  I got it.  …  Only on the rarest of occasions…
There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
Toby now has the floor…  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.  Let me rephrase that.  I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl.  Here we go!
Yes, good.  Fine.  Like stretching and…
Um, yeah.  You’re computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it’s also recommended that you step away for about… about ten minutes every hour.
Wow, that is… that time really adds up.  That’s like… a half an hour, every hour?
Ok, you know what?  You’re making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.
Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain’t it?
Ok guys, you know what?  I didn’t— I didn’t interrupt when you were having your presentation.
Yes.  Okay, let’s do another one.  This is a good one.  “A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute—“
Yes.  “Which can contribute to heart disease.”  Heart disease kills more people that balers.
That’s called having a fat butt, Michael.
Yeah, yeah.  That’s, that’s fat butt disease.  That’s what you suffer from?
Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
Yeah?  I bet you’d like to swim with this sea monster, wouldn’t you?
Kelly, you insulted the gentleman.  Please apologize.
Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours.  So, I—
That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you, Mike.  It’s serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin’ on your biscuit.  Never havin’ to risk it.
Okay.  … What, Nerf isn’t cool anymore?
[Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten.
Really, ten?  That’s your guess?  You’re a professional accountant.
I don’t know how the whole betting thing started, but it’s fun.
That is not fair.  He has spent hours up here at reception with you.
Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?
Working in an office can lead to depression.  Which can lead to suicide.  I mean this is really serious stuff.
I— I—  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin’ fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that…
It’s really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.
They use props.  They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
Idiots!  God, what are we gonna do!?
I don’t know, I don’t know.  Because you know what our killer is?  Depression—
No time to sew a quilt.  … I got it.  Give me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store.
So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let’s just say that I just sent back
I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]
Ryan, well done.  Two minutes, forty-two seconds.  Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said “awesome” 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
[on the roof] Okay, let’s do this thing!  I’ll go summon the troops!
Maybe we should test it first.  Letterman-style.  Throw a TV over, or…
[Creed takes a bite of an apple] Creed is eating an apple.  I found a potato.
Hello. [Jim replaces Creed’s apple with a potato][Creed takes a bite of the potato]
I don’t know this place as well as I thought I did.  I’m getting cleaned out.
[drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]
BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh… crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess.
Find out whose car that is.  If it’s Stanley’s, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
Have Pa–adge do it, or… the sea monster.
It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.
Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
What do you think?  You’ve got an hour.
I’m gonna need… I’m gonna need petty cash.
Un-shun.  Yeah that sounds good.  Re-shun.
Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.
When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, we’re not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking.
That’s right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It’s rock n’ roll!
[imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near!
[singing] Michael is awesome!  Jumpin’ off the roof!
[singing] Bouncin’ on the bouncy bounce!  Show ’em who’s boss!
[singing] Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
I am ready to do this!  I am ready to make a point! [Dwight continues air guitar]
[out of breath] Guys!  Listen up!  Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
[hesitates] Un-shun.  I think he’s suffering from depression. Re-shun.
Ok, when’s the shunning thing gonna end?
Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
No really, it’s, it’s very nice.  Come on!
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
Everybody’s gonna be fine in exactly what they’re wearing, let’s go!  Let’s go!
[outside] Come on, hurry up you guys!
[on the roof] My life!  Oh, my life…
[on megaphone] Michael, what’s wrong?!
Everything’s wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
Depression?  Isn’t that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study!
Is that the last year the data was available?
Yes!  My head is in such pain!  And turmoil!
I didn’t… [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn’t think you needed them for this part.
What are the odds that this is in any way real?
Okay, I’d like ten bucks on those odds.
If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it.  If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a
Michael’s up on the roof and he’s acting strange!
Everything is wrong, Dwight.  The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
Depressed?  Isn’t that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!
Oh, excuse me.  It’s my… favorite part.
[zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there’s a… there’s a castle over there.
No, there’s nothing to see over there, people!  There’s nothing to see.  …They found the castle, Michael.
Oh… God.  Oh my God, he’s gonna jump.
Oh.  He’s going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
Hey uh, Michael.  Don’t jump on the bouncy castle.  You can’t do that, because you’re going to get horribly, horribly injured.
Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
Come down and… open it and you’ll see.
Dwight, find out what the present is.
Okay, uh… I don’t see anything.  She might be bluffing.
Oh… It’s uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they’re only available in Japan.
Dwight, you are such a liar.  Pam, really, what is it?
Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you’re gonna serious hurt yourself.
You told me, that I lead a… cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.
Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
A lot… of things.  Uh, you, uh… What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It’s goin’ good, right?
It’s complicated with Jan.  And I don’t know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isn’t nearly as good as it used to be.
Mike, you’re a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
I couldn’t do it. I— I ain’t that strong.  And I ain’t that brave.
Okay.  Pam, I’m coming down to get my present.
When people think of Andy, they think of hate and anger. When people think of Drew, they think of baked goods.
Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible?
They are the worst. Who’s this Drew chick?
Oh no, nobody likes my cookies. I’m so angry, argh I want to hit something. [laughs] Totally kidin’ guys.
Little device I learned to diffuse tension, be the first to make fun of yourself, because if they make fun of you before you do… Then you might lose your mind.
[pours the last of the coffee into his mug]
It’s OK. I can’t always have what I want, but I can always want what I have.
Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? ‘Cause that’s what we have.
People don’t need to be afraid of me. I can’t achieve anger any more, and I have a new car. Toyota Prius, because Andy didn’t care about fuel efficiency, but Drew has seen “An Inconvenient Truth”. Nearly twice.
[walks around Andy’s new car keying it]
OK, come on everybody, go time. Pam let’s go.
I thought I’d stay and answer the phones.
Don’t worry Pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life… Your long lovely life. [whispers to camera] saved it.
Like we’re going to the science museum.
I’ve been told that I’m a tactile learner.
Buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.
You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.
Kelly, Ryan looks great. You should be thankful that you…
Sir, could you please, please focus on Darryl?
No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?
… because they had a much scarier safety presentation.
How do you make depression sexy? How do you… How do you get people interested in depression? That is the conon… the conun… the conumbery
Those warehouse guys, think that we are all flabby, middle management, nerf balls. Well I’m going to show them that we have nerfs of steel. [winks]
[Michael, Andy, and Dwight are standing around a trampoline] You know guys, I recently learned some pretty cool stuff about the difference between feeling something and… acting on that thing.
Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.
You know Drew, why don’t you go inside. Dwight come here. Where should we put this?
OK, good. Thank you. Wanna take our time, do this right.
[phone rings] Hello?  Hi Bob Vance. [laughs]
You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha.
I always knew my co-workers were annoying. I never realized I could profit from it. Go ahead Bob Vance, call Phyllis, all day.
[Michael is up on the roof of the building] Michael, go ahead, we’re listening.
I’m going to wait. I don’t want to say this twice, it’s too painful and I’m too depressed.
[talking through bullhorn] Michael, you can not fly, you can not, I’ve seen this too many times.
Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I’m so adorable.
I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there’s stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four.
OK, if he’s not down by four, I’ll get the papers up to him.
OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.
Don’t play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don’t get it.
Let me borrow that chief. Michael, you don’t have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. So don’t jump just to prove anything to us. OK? That said, if you need to prove something to yourself, you should jump.
If you do jump, I want you to reach for the sky.
OK. careful, thanks. [takes bullhorn from Andy]
Grab a comet and kiss the moon! Kiss it!
See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know.
You own a convertible. Come on man that’s, that’s hot. Women love that stuff right?
It’s only leased, and it’s got rust damage, he’ll never get his deposit back.
[in parking lot] Goodnight Stanley. [sees his car is keyed, just nods his head]
Well that’s debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought—
Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
Bears do not— What is going on— What are you doing?!
Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that’s a grand total of… [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.
You know what?  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk]  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!  Millions of families suffer every year!
[on phone] Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations?
[on phone] Absolutely.  I couldn’t be more sorry about this.
[on phone] I know, I know.  We’re all trying to get to the bottom of this.
[on phone] I am upset.  Don’t I sound upset?
[on phone] It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, we’re going to recalling all of that paper.
Everybody in here.  STAT.  No time to lose.  Cri-Man-Squa.  F and C, doubletime.
Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go.  Any other questions?
One more.  Why are you talking like that?
Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!  Forget it.  Where is Creed?
Creed.  Quality assurance.  Your job.  I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed.  Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
Every week I’m supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill.  And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.
We have a lot of angry customers out there.  This puts us at threat level midnight.  Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.
This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S.  This
[getting a pill from the bottle] I don’t have a headache.  I’m just preparing.
Jim, big fire in your house.  Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.  Went home to all the kids.
No, no, no, no.  Not good enough.  This is a keystone account.  I want you in the school.  In person.
No, sweet cheeks.  We need someone who’s actually made a sale.  Andy, you go.
[English accent] William Dolittle at your service.  A.K.A., Will Do.
Yeah, I’m definitely gonna go alone.
No, no.  I need two men on this.  That’s what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
Yes!  You are entering the “No Spin Zone!”
No, Pam.  The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
Here’s the thing.  When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.  Alert the media, and then you control the story.  Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.  That’s what happened to O.J.
I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.  The press wants a story, I will give them a story.
The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job.  I will do whatever it takes to survive.  Like I did… when I was a homeless man.
Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you’re not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap]
I wonder how many phone calls you’re missing while you’re teaching us to answer calls.
Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?
[in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.
[in accent] I like ice cream too, mate.  Alligators and dingo babies.
Hand me that water.  I always say “Beer me.”  Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time.  So how’s what’s-her-name?
Who, Karen?  Yeah, she’s only one of my oldest friends.  [takes swig of water] Mmm.  How’s the apartment hangin’?
Nice.  Check out this sunshine, man.  Global warming, right?  Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.
What about music?  Do you have any music?
I was thinkin’ about more like a CD, or… a CD.
Your call, dude.  My girlfriend made an awesome mix.  Beer me that disc.
So, Tuna.  When we get in there, let’s do a really good job, okay?
Well not everything a guy says needs to be said.  Sometimes it’s just about the music of the conversation.
Whoa!  What the— Why is my girlfriend here?
Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
No, she’s a part-time frozen yogurt chef.
I wonder if she’s, like, a… a guidance counselor, or something?
OK, press conference in 45.  Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
On it.  OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage.  Pam, run a comb through your hair.
First rule in road-side beet sales: Put the most attractive beets on top.  The ones that make you pull the car over and go, “Wow, I need this beet right now.”  Those are the money beets.
[Chad Lite walks in the door] [to Office workers] Hey!  [snaps twice] Look sharp!  [to Chad Lite] Hey!  Uh, Hi.  Hello, Dwight Schrute.
And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.
Scranton Times.  Chad Lite, “Lighter Side of Life.”
Oh, dear God.  OK, here are your credentials.  You’ve been granted level three security clearance.
Don’t get too excited, that’s out of 20.  Right this way.  Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly.  Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don’t have a
You never told me you were in high-school!
This is weird.  I… gotta go to Spanish.
Well… that’s not gonna hold up in court.
Huh… We didn’t do anything illegal.  Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.
[on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point.  I’m sorry.  No, I am
[on phone] Really, Dixon City? …Carbondale.
[on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don’t see how that’s our fault.  And I’ve already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don’t know what you want from me. [hangs up]
OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing
When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.
Now I’m told she told her manager she had the flu.  I’m a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there.  We would have caught this.
Yes, I’ll be sure someone returns your call.  I’m so sorry.  Bye.
Hello, I’m looking for Michael Scott.
Mrs. Allen is our most important client… because every client is our most important client.  Even though she’s a pretty unimportant client, really.
[snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.
So, let us consider this matter ended.
Well it isn’t ended.  I’m… I’m very angry. I— I could have lost business.
I know, I know you’re angry.  And we are truly, truly sorry.
I don’t accept your apology.  The watermark was obscene and horrifying.
Who was that guy she was talking to?  At her locker.
Not important.  Because you’re not dating her.  Because it’s a felony.
The issue with the watermark is very serious.
We teach our students that character counts.
[scoffs] Pfft.  You don’t teach it well enough.  One of your students is a
I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook.  A full page, two words—
[on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That’s nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He’s upset about the watermark.
OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we’re doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you’re sorry.
[on phone] It was an unfortunate error.
…and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette’s or something!
We… are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
Well, it— it doesn’t help, because it already happened to me.
The watermark… it’s a one time thing.
I don’t care!  It was disgusting.  Cartoon characters having sex?
May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.
I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin’ a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
I, for starters, I think that you should resign.
Well… [exhales] OK, well…  Um, wasn’t really my fault.  The guys at the papermill—
The guys at the papermill— No no no!
Yes, and that makes it your responsibility—
No— my— OK, this is insane.  You can get out of here.  Get out!
That’s insane.  We’ll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
I’m calling the Better Business Bureau.
Yeah, well I’m calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! [to Chad Lite] Did you get all that?
We gotta do something. [exhales] This is spinning out of control, Pam.  This is just, not…
No, then Newsweek picks it up.  And then CNN does a story about it.  Then… YouTube gets a hold of it…
You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
You’re right.  It will blow over.  But it’s not… going to take… a week or two.  [pulls out a video camcorder from his desk] Do you know what this is for?
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a woman’s touch.
[Dwight is spraying far too much hairspray into Michael’s hair] OK, I think that’s good.
Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
That’s how devoted I am to this job.
They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
Do you think you’re taking it a little… literally, Dwight?  And now we’re wasting tape.  I’m gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?
Yeah, well you didn’t know that when you filled out this payroll form.
Yeah, well at least I didn’t suck at customer relations.  Oooh, yes.  Facial.
I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
Still said it, so… [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]
That’s… they always give an ultimatum.
Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.
[to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown.  I thought maybe you’d like to sign it.  Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her.  She’s got some children.
Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you’ll be all right.
[singing the intro to The Lion King’s “The Lion Sleeps Tonight”] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh…
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh…
[Joins in with classic Andy falsetto] Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh…
Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh…
Hey, Dwight.  You look really nice today.
[scoffs] Pssssh.  I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
Yeah, that’s cause I’m… you’re boyfriend, Jim Halpert.  Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you’re my girlfriend?
[Dwight imitates the “Jim face”] Look at that.
I’m Jim Halpert. [more horrible “Jim faces”]
The key to a crisis is dealing with it right away. Like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles. If you don’t act fast, you will lose customers.
Hello, CNN? I need to speak to your Scranton-area bureau chief? All right, then the bureau chief for the Greater Wilkes-Barre area? How about, ah, Lackawanna County. Okay, Northeastern Pennsylvania then. This is extremely urgent! No… you put
Customer service isn’t like accounting. It’s not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer.
I wonder how many phone calls you’re missing while you’re teaching us to answer phone calls.
The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you’re sorry. Do that and you’ll be fine. Make sense?
Excuse me. You’re Creed Bratton, guitar player for Grass Roots in the late 1960s.
Oh, oh that’s right! Good work. Thank you very much, sir [shakes hand].
About 10 years ago, for tax reasons, I faked my own death. I’ve been collecting benefits as my own widow ever since.
Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.
She acts older, too. She knows everything about European history, and photosynthesis, and she made me this lanyard with, like, a Fimo clay thing. She’s a real Renaissance woman.
Or a high school girl. Let’s go [mouths ‘wow’ to the camera].
That’s what I was eating, in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven for dinner. And I got out of the car to shake the crumbs off my shirt, and this smoking hot woman comes up and we strike up a conversation.
She lets me buy her and her friends some wine coolers for a dinner party she’s going to.
You shouldn’t be talking about that.
I threw in some scratch tickets, ’cause generous guy, and next thing you know we’re making out in the woods.
Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.
No, we were really making out in the woods.
With dissatisfied clients, it doesn’t matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you’re sorry. They’re like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I’m sorry, it will be twice as effective.
[whispering] Say you’re sorry times infinity…
…’cause there’s no comeback for that.
You understand? You… you get this check.
Yeah. I’m Mr. Bernard Johnson, MD. I’d like to talk with Jamie about a certain heart condition. Diagnosis:
Sir? You need to get out of here, before I call the police, okay?
Yeah, maybe you should call the police. See whose side they take. Warning, most cops are dudes.
Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.
Why am I getting all of the bad ones?
Why can’t you just say you’re sorry and make them feel better?
I’m not gonna lie and say I’m sorry when the company didn’t do anything wrong. That’s immoral, and this is ridiculous.
Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you’re old enough to be my mother.
What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you’re a slut and everyone thinks so.
Well, you’re fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.
If cartoon characters didn’t have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]
The customer is always right. Mrs. Allen was our customer. She was wrong. Is that a contradiction? No. Because she’s not our customer anymore.
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother.
Hey, Mom. Happy birthday, belatedly. Sorry I forgot. I had put it on my calendar and Pam threw that out.
My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.
And without denying the seriousness of the situation, I would just like to remind you that in much of the Netherlands, swimming naked is the norm. So in Norway, you’d be the weirdos.
Okay, Andy, we need to go. Seriously.
Dude, there she is. Don’t look, don’t look. She’s sitting with Denise. How am I supposed to do this? Denise hates me.
What is your problem, man? Can’t you support a bro? That’s why you don’t have any friends, Tuna. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I just, I need…
Yeah. I lo- I love her. Is this what love is?  This, like, horrible feeling in my stomach?
No, that’s your conscience. Listen to it.
Look, okay, just be my wingman. Beer me five minutes. Talk to Denise. She’s really into White Russians and whippets.
Jamie, can I talk to you for a second?
[sits down next to Denise] So, high school.
You should take up a musical instrument.
Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He’s a jerk, right?
He’s dead. Hey, do you have any weed?
No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?
Very well [hangs up phone]. I just got a call from Debbie Brown over at the mill. She claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself.
No time. Dwight, I love Debbie Brown. She’s a close personal friend. But quality is my life. This company has a reputation to uphold. As much as it pains me, someone has to be held accountable.
You’re right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down.
Okay. We good? Okay, that’s enough Aqua Net.
Hey, Angela. I’m sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don’t know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it’s no excuse. So, I’m very sorry.
Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn’t called you stupid.
No, but some of your outfits are not appr-
That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she’ll be less of a grump.
Kelly’s not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].
[reads demerit] “Jim Halpert, tardiness.” Ugh. I love it already.
You’ve gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
[scoffs] Let’s put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
Three demerits and you’ll receive a citation.
OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
[door opens] Hey, Phyllis. You all right?
[jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!
What happened? What can I do to help?
[on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they’ve already had three calls.
[to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?
Um… I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out… on the map.
The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what’s all the fuss?
If that’s flashing, then lock me up.
[whispering] It’s just, like, so creepy.
[whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering]
Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher]
Um… I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh… Karen from behind?
[laughing softly] I’m sorry. It’s pretty funny when you think about it.
Hey, what’s going on? There’s a police car in the…
What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down]
Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It’s, uh… [laughs]
I don’t think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she’s not even here, so no harm, no foul.
I don’t think the women in this office –
Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you’re the flasher.
I was at a parent-teacher conference.
Uh-huh. Prove it. Let’s see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I… you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
…come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
I don’t know. I feel… I drive a lot. I’m spending a fortune on gas and tolls –
I’ll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I’ll leave it on the dresser.
Um, that… I don’t know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.
You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you’re coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
[exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can’t happen. Not in my house.
Agreed. Let me show you what I’ve been working on.
[lays a folder full of pictures on Michael’s desk] There are several penises there I’d love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
Dwight, are those your pants? That’s a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand]
Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.
Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis – I think you know what I’m referring to – Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
[raises hand] Question. Won’t that interfere with your other task forces?
Phyllis, sorry. I’ve got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
That’s OK. I don’t feel like answering phones.
Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
[reads memo] “Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.” Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]
Look, it’s really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
See? That’s what we’re talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?
No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That’s it. Conference room, five minutes. Women’s appreciation.
Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
Oh, I don’t know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?
[eating banana] Mm, less than three.
You know what? Why doesn’t Oscar run the meeting? He’s a homosexual.
Why don’t you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
Those are collectible action figures and they’re worth more than your car.
You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
I, um… would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?
Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.
OK, no catfights. Please. Let’s – my point is… my point is… a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.
Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
What you’re saying is extremely misogynistic.
Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.
I’m saying that you’re being sexist.
No. I’m being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
Because wha… that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
And when we get mad, you always ask us if we’re on our periods.
I have to know whether you’re serious or not.
If I could menstruate, I wouldn’t have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I’d just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I’d be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
You’re right. You’re right, you’re right. And you know why? It’s because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we’re gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]
Frankly, it’s kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So… I could do that.
OK, let’s go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let’s go!
[Pam’s sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert’s face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
Meredith, slow down! We’re not gonna get there any faster if we’re dead.
Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window]
Oh, yeah. You really shouldn’t litter.
Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women’s bathroom?
Not really. I’ve seen a bathroom before.
Yeah, but… it’s every guy’s fantasy.
I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.
Of course you do, moon face. That’s because you’re a preppy freak, you’re the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
No, duh. That’s why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
[Meredith parking the car] I don’t think she’s gonna make it. Don’t think she’s gonna make it – [metal scraping]
It’s a little too tight. I’m gonna find another spot.
[marks Scranton  with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we
[in women’s bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
Hey, uh… where’d you decide to take Karen tonight?
Nothing – I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
No, we’ve been dating for six months.
Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um –
Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she’s not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
I figured. It’s cool. I don’t – I wouldn’t want to be in an office relationship anyway.
You’re welcome. You’re welcome, you’re welcome. OK. So, let’s dish.
Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it “shmear?” Like the cream cheese.
OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
What, um… what do you think of role-play?
Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
I just… I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I’m forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
Michael, you shouldn’t do anything that you’re uncomfortable with.
Jan says anything that doesn’t scare us is not worth doing. I don’t know. Maybe we’re different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
[groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
No, it’s not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
Michael, you need to get out of this.
No, she’s… she’s fooling around. It’s a woman thing.
No, normal women don’t do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he’s about to start crying]
No… No, it’s all right. I’m OK. I’m OK. [sniffing] You guys… what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]
OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.
Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts:
She’s totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
Michael… you shouldn’t be with someone who doesn’t make you happy.
I’m happy sometimes. Um… when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.
Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
Maybe. But it sounds like you’re just wrong for each other.
That sounds good too. I don’t know who’s right. I just don’t – I don’t know. I don’t know.
I bet you know. Don’t think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.
Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria’s Secret] Come on. Get in here.
[in women’s bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.
What are you doing in here? This is the women’s room.
I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall]
[wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I’m a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women’s room for number two. I’ve been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
Mm. You don’t want anything? My treat. Some panties or… pick a thong or… G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any – it just – you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.
Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?
Jim’s gonna love it. [Karen giggles]
I’m kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don’t need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
[in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael’s cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.
Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply]  It’s Jan. What do I do?
[snickers at Pam’s sketch] That is pretty cool.
Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
Uh, yeah. Yep. Um… Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will…
Here, uh… Meredith? Why don’t you put your hazards on.
Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let’s see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the… all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts]
Do you have a… a crescent? A crescent Allan?
I don’t think we really need that, Michael.
Uh… you know what? I’m going to… you take care of that. I’m gonna do traffic… detail.
You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe’s already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!
Yeah, I do. ‘Cause justice never rests.
[pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies?
No. Wholesies. [snatches the candy bar]
Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.
Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar]
Yep. If you don’t mind, I think I’ll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.
You know, I may have underestimated you. You’re not a total ass. [coughs]
You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let’s do this. Let’s do it. [sighs]
I love you guys.  Now I’m getting her voicemail.
[cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I’m sorry.
One second. Oh! It’s from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
OK. [voice on phone] “It’s me, Michael. I’m just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want…”
Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] “… to remain friends. Or at least business associates -” [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] “who get along. Oh, just so you know, it’s not me, it’s you. OK, buddy.”
[phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.
No, you’re not. I’m looking right at you.
Don’t. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.
You have information about the sex predator?
In the women’s bathroom, above the sink.
[hangs up and runs to the women’s bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!
So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?
Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?
Good, good, it’s the best business reporting isn’t it?
Uh, yeah, it’s okay. Its just, I don’t think the cartoons are very funny.
The a cartoon that goes with each article.  This one says Mel Karmazin?  I don’t, I don’t know. I guess I get it.
Phyllis got flashed in the parking lot.
Okay, you need to stop that right now.
Hey good lookin’, what ya got cookin’?
I got nothing cooking, it’s cooked.  It’s borscht and its served cold.
Hey listen, I’m sure everyone’s already told you but, your presentation out there, was pretty inspiring stuff. Must be nice being a woman around here, knowing they have a protector in you.
If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.
Borscht, according to Dwight it’s best served cold.  You know what else is best served cold?  Yeah, gazpacho.  You see what I’m doing?  I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups.  This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight’s trust.
Orgasms, why can women have them? Yep?
No. I’m not a lawyer, but I don’t think this is the place to do this.
Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman.  I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see.  And, um, it’s uncomfortable.  So maybe I do understand.
[sings] We’re going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye.
Lets go, fall out, let’s go.  Move, move, move, move, move.
Look at that! Come on! Free underwear!
It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand…
Hey, Pam, how bout something like that for you.  Could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section.  Just show off the twins a little bit.
You can make people believe anything.  Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups.  Why?  I don’t know.  I don’t have to know.  That’s what makes me so dangerous.
Just… all over. I don’t want to do anything… I’m dying…
No, that’s not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
Right there. [Michael points to computer screen.]
[reading from screen] “Abdomen. Menses.”
“The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.”
About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.
To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?
And Gromit. [David sighs] Jan? Is Jan there?
Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan’s heart, David, and it was awful. It was… It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes…
…you just gots to get your freak on.
I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
Oh I’m excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I’m wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?
Well, you can’t swim in leather pants. [laughs] I’m just yankin’ your chain.  Not literally.
Oh, you know what? Uh, you’re not going.
Yeah, I know. I’m sorry, Toby. We… um… Somebody has to stay here.
I want today to be a beautiful memory… that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it… then it’ll suck.
Oh, great. I forgot mine and I’m wearing a two piece.
Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people’s character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
You want me to write down people’s indefinable qualities?
I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?
I have the most boring job in the office, so… why wouldn’t I have the most boring job on beach day?
I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.
Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
If you don’t like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn’t just a trip to the beach.
Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm’s turning people off.
I hope there will be management parables.
Well, [whispering] Hey Pam, did you get that down?
Like everything I said and everything they did and… Just don’t…
Well write it down before you forget it. That’s… You’ve just been drawing pictures. [sighs] Rrrr. I can’t stay mad at you.
Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. [Gets off bus] Watch out for snakes!
Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.
Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.
We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn’t do that.
[starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort …[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
OK, seriously. You really shouldn’t be saying that.
Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok… Stanley, your team name?
Then I will name your team the Red team.
I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.
Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.
Andy Bernard. Pros: He’s classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don’t really trust him.
It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.
There’s already a twist, you’re carrying an egg on a spoon.
Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis’ egg falls off spoon] Ahh…
Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle]
Phyllis is out. Yes! [to Kelly] Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good. [Cheers]
I know I’m near the big rock. I just know it.
[takes off blindfold] I just don’t want to get hit by it…
What’re you doing? No! See, now we’re disqualified.
I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone]
[to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There’s a hole. Step over the hole.
Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
[to Ryan] Come on!  Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
Can you just stop this right now, or I’m not gonna do this anymore.
You have to stop yelling at me or I’m not gonna do the egg race.
That’s what being a good captain is about. It’s about listening to the members of your team.
[to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!
[lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh]
There’s nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh… diligent note-taking. [holds up notes]
[off screen] Pam…you’re missing things. [shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook]
[at Ryan holding egg in spoon] Let’s go! Let’s go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard! [Ryan takes off blindfold and throws it to ground along with egg and spoon] What the? Damn it temp!
[begins to clap] Great job everyone, that was fantastic. [Michael sighs]
Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.
Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it’s not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I’m going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
Like umm…[looks at watch] ten minutes?
A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.
No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
It’s very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table]
Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease… Let’s just… OK, it’s very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it’ll slide down your gullet more easily.
Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
You can’t say, or you can’t pronounce it?
The winner gets a regional manager’s salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
Can we just take those first two things?
The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I’m interviewing for a job at corporate. And they’re only interviewing a handful of people and I’m the most qualified and I’ll probably get it. Alright?
I didn’t want to tell anyway. I didn’t want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don’t know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
[slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast]
Do you expect me to believe that you’re truly making your recommendations on this basis?
[points at Stanley] Word. [Stanley starts eating hot dog] There we go. Let’s see it.
I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!
[holding a fish with all the meat stripped off] Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs!
What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
No. I was saying that before. Not now.  Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
It’s very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
Uh, we don’t have any safety mittens
Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It’s alright.  It’s alright. Here we go.
[growly noises, Jim looks terrified]
[to Jim] Sorry about that. It’s all about taking points away from Dwight.
Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man’s eyes… ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
[Andy and Dwight sumo wrestle] Gaaaaa….
I didn’t win. But the only reason I didn’t win is because I recently learned that it’s better to work thing out with words.
Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.
Yeah, right, c’mon! C’mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle]
[bouncing off of Andy] Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
[Trying to wet bandana, falls in water] Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!
What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
Go tell them I’m floating away, obviously!
I don’t understand what you want from me.
Angela, it’s pretty simple! Look at what I’m doing and go tell somebody about it!
I think they’re even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don’t really know how to compare those units.
Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
[on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I’ll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
Hello?  Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well.
How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
If this job is in a well, I don’t want it.
What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.
How so? I mean… sure thing, that sounds smart… I can’t do this anymore! I’m goin’ to sit in the bus.
Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
I’m not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
I’m gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That’s the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
But I’m not kidding.  I really want to do it.
Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you’re up.
Oh, ’cause I don’t want my feet to get burned.
You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
Who’s next? Andy? Where’s Andy? Andy is never here today.
[lying in water, car lights light up his location] Hello?  Who’s there?  My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin.  Hello?
Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
And that is not the same at all. If you’re going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. ‘kay. [clears throat, breathes noisily] The mind has to wrap around the foot. [exhales] Okay.
Count the other way. Count… no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
One. Two. Three!  Go! Do it!  Go, Michael.
Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
No! It’s okay. I will do this Michael.
[walking on coals] I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
[standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
[falling on his knees, then on all fours] Aaagh, aaagh!
[yelling excitedly for Dwight to get off the coals]
Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
Hey, I know what you’re looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don’t think I should be considered as your replacement.
Michael, on Thursday I’m going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
Hhhh… okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.
[breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh…
[finishes story] I mean truly repulsive acts.
Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.
So we have about an hour and a half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus. Fun on wheels. Only way to travel. Besides a monorail.
Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy.
Sometimes Michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang. That’s Michael, me, Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, Meredith, Kelly and Ryan. We’re a regular Ocean’s Eleven.
Jim, David Wallace is calling for you.
Pam, you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together. How did that work out?
You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don’t talk to him anymore really.
[Sign says ‘No Alcohol, No Loud Talking’] Um, What the hell?
It’s a bus that takes you to a party. Here we go.
Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here?
Then, Mr. Driver, we are off like a herd of turtles! Johnny Carson. [Meredith runs to catch up to bus with her large drink cup]
Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this?
I know, we’re putting on a play for Japanese investors.
You are really annoying me. If you don’t knock it off…
…I’m never gonna tell you anything ever again. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
No. We’re only 10 minutes from the lake.
Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed]
Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor.
No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That’s a hazard.
Very good, Jim. Pam, please note that Jim is very astute. All right, are we ready?
Are you not gonna put out the torches?
I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he’s eye candy. It’s OK, Bob… Vance knows he’s on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.
It is an honor just to be considered for Michael’s job. Honestly. And if I win it, then I will be ordering a pretty sizeable Most Improved Player plaque to put over the hole I punched in the wall.
[sighs] Okay. Pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?
Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.
Because he wasn’t following the rules.
But they didn’t complete their task, Pam! If people can’t carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?
Exactly. Are you sure you’re doing that right? Taking an awfully long time.
It’s very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can…
Son of a bitch. God! Okay. All right you know what? Here we go. On your mark! Get set!
No mustard! No mustard! Just… eat it. Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.
No, no, no, no, not that— just… come on, you guys, let’s do it! I’m serious. Who’s got the hungry?
Ryan, I want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth. Right now.
Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don’t know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.
[Dwight and Stanley are in sumo suits] Ready! Go!
The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss. [laughs]
[Dwight knocks Stanley down] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Eat sand, you fat, old man!
Oh, I’m out of it. Let’s face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot.
Michael, since Andy isn’t here, maybe I could be the team captain.
I know, but I’d like to give this a try.
Don’t try to flirt your way into this. Sometimes you really creep me out.
[in sumo suit, waves down a car, which swerves around him, runs after it, waving his arms] Wait! [throws sumo hair-hat at the retreating car]
Andy Bernard is in first place with four hot dogs!  Dwight Schrute is a close second with three and a half!  Here comes Stanley!  Here comes Stanley, with three hot dogs!
Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I’d drop in and say hello.
You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?
Naaah. You know what? Since I’m here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
Um, how many people are you interviewing?
We’re only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?
Great. One more… question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
I’m really looking forward to our interview.
And I’m really looking forward to working with you.
I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I’ll be like three hours late.
[Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.
What’s different about you? You look worse.
Blup-dup-do. What’s up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.
Sorry, I can’t hear you Big Haircut.
Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
But that’s my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don’t screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you.
[sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.
It’s okay, we all say things without thinking.
Oh, no it’s not that, I’ve actually been thinking that for a long time, and I’m glad I said it. I just… I’m sorry if it made you feel weird.
Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
Ahhh… just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let’s do it.
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early ’cause we want to spend the night in the city.
No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger…
Ah, we’re gonna go tonight, but we’re gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
Yeah, I’m not going to talk about this now.
Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else?
Well I mean Pam’s face is really pretty too. It’s a very tough call.
You know what? Why don’t you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
Hey, Pam I’ve been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
I’ve never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
You know what? Don’t even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
I remember. I blogged the whole thing.
www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out.
There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
Do you think it’s gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
No. Not at all. I haven’t talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
Maybe you should talk to her? Before…
No, no, no. You know what? It’s a done deal. I basically have the job already. There’s nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
I’m sorry, that just doesn’t make sense.
Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo…
But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk]
You’re not sure that you have the job.
I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.
How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
No Dwight, I don’t care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I’m taking his job.
[smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
[squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It’s my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.
No. And the sheets are made of fire.
Sorry, we’re all booked up. Hell convention in town.
You’re not the manager even in your own fantasy?
I’m the owner.  The co-owner. With Satan!
Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
Yeah, but I haven’t told you my salary yet.
Once I’m officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
[signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view.
I’m good. How are you, Janet? It’s good to see you.
I’m great. Uh, can we, can we talk… privately… for a minute?
I just, [quietly] I uh… I don’t uh… I, I don’t, I don’t like the way that we left things.
Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don’t you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.
Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.
Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
Weird. Yeah, I didn’t get both of your messages.
So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim’s and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?
After you ended… everything with us, I went on a vacation.
It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I’ll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
I’ve made some big changes in my life and… I miss you. I want us to get back together.
Ohh… [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
Defcon twenty.  She wants to get back together.
I don’t know, that’s why you’re here, help me. Please…
Do you want to get back together with her?
Just don’t get back together with her.
How can she make you get back together with her?
She made me do a lot of things I didn’t wanna do.
This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
You’re so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I’m gonna go in there and tell her that we can’t be together.
I’m in a very good place right now. Thank you.
[walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged]
Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
[moves to block Jim from Pam’s eyeline] Oh my God.  Can you believe that?
No, it’s fine.  I’m sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around… that
I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
I find it offensive.  Au natural, baby.  That’s how I like ’em.  Swing low, sweet chariots.
So… [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation…
Let’s get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs]
No.  No, no, no, no.  I’ll tell you this, it is
Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps]  Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy’s name]  Andrew Bernard.
All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck!
No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.
Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]
I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?
White, because it contains all other colors.
Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?
You make a chair, but you don’t sit on it.
The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.
Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don’t wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
You’re not off to a very good start, Bernard.
I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn’t you say?
I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.
[Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.
This interview is over. I’ll let you know.
[Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or…
Oh, you know I’m gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend’s house.
Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
No, I’m sorry I should have been clearer. It’s for me.
Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
Good luck with your interview. [whispers] Bye.
So, I guess we’re getting back together.
Your advice was good, but Jan’s was bigger.
Here’s the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn’t connect, I was miserable. Now, I’m in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.
So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first?
Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
I think you’ll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
[Dwight clicks off tape player] Who’s ready to work?
That wasn’t him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]
So what’s going to happen to us when I get this job?
Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can’t stay there.
Yeah, I do. C’mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
[exhales] How are you guys doing?  Need anything?
I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody’s names.  If you need to know somebody’s name, just ask me.
No, no, no, just… that’s not his real name.  That’s just what I call him, so…
My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.
As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael’s World’s Best Boss mug]
Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad. [washing out Michael’s mug]
Hey!  Hunter!  Wha’s up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
Just say, “I want to squeeze them.”  It’s code.  She’ll know what it means.
Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the “motorboat” noise] “Brbrbrbrbr!” also?
You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
I had to make Andy my number two.  It’s political, complicated, you wouldn’t understand.  I want you… to be Assistant Regional Manager.
Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title… to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
Okay.  So… you would be the Regional Manager,
Mmmmmm, let’s call it Secret Assistant
I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret… you reply, “Absolutely, I do.”
Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
Why don’t I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
Well, my weaknesses are actually… strengths.
Then who do you think will get the job?
Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
Do you really think he’s qualified for that job?
No, but he wasn’t qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
[raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.
Just… zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group’s time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!
Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
Yes!  Michael is gone.  There’s a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is “me.”  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!
I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.
What do you think we could be doing better?
It is always a treat when our paths cross.
Yes.  And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her… or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that’s not sexual, just… we’re all professionals.
Okay, uh.  Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position… the job you’re applying for… is Jan’s job.
I don’t understand. So, we’re gonna tag team it?
Listen up.  Let’s start… from the ground
[at the same time as Dwight] Forest.
Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.
Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
We— Don’t you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?
No.  In fact, I’ll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
What’s the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.
HEY!  COME ON!  Let’s listen to Dwight’s presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam]
So, that’s… my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows?
Okay.  Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but…
…what do you think about Michael Scott?
He’s a very nice man.  And he’s very well suited for the job he has now.
Oh. [they kiss] I’ll put in a good word for you.
Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
Daaah, let’s just run away together.  Let’s just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would… be fine.  We’d have fun.
What’s… what’s the matter?  What… what happened in there?
Jan, this isn’t the time, we’re in an interview—
Frankly, it’s overdue.  Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.
[opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?
No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
‘Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company.  You are clearly unstable.
Okay, you know what?  I’m just not leaving.  I’m not leaving.  Not leaving.
It’s like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.
It’s like outerspace without the stars, it’s so black. [laughs]
It’s so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here… is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
Don’t let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
So, I am gonna… give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.
Actually, Michael, I think we’re gonna take it in another direction.
Good, I’m glad we’re on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
You know what?  That… is actually good… because, um, I don’t think I could take… my girlfriend’s job.  That’s not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?
Good.  Very good.  I’m glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.
Good.  That’s all I ever wanted.  These two. [points at Jim and Karen] Either one of them… excellent candidates.
Wow.  That was some serious… hardcore… self destruction.
Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.
Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don’t have to stay, if you don’t want.
Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so…
[phone rings, picks up] Dunder Mifflin, this is Grace.  Sure.
Oh, God!  I mean, I just don’t understand!  It’s just
I know.  I know, I’m sorry about that.  That was terrible.
Oh, just… No, actually I think it’s good, you know?  It’s fine, actually, I do.  I really think it’s great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so… [laughs]
Well, it’s… [Jan starts crying, high pitched whining] No, don’t cry, it’s gonna be OK.
[sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It’s just… I’m sorry.  It’s just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?
[whispers] I don’t know.  [normal volume] Well I guess… you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
[in the office, imitating the terminator] I’ll be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!
No.  No, Pam.  I’m baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.
You shouldn’t have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing I’m baaaaaack.  [laughs] Ryan, coffee.
So I’m back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place… is like… the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my… graveyard… for my bones.
[to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin’ on that coffee.
I wanted to thank you… for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]
I don’t know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.
I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]
Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim.  You’re clearly a very bright guy.
Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet—
I’m sorry, wait, so is the question “How’d I get to be so awesome?” [laughs] Because, I don’t have an answer for you. [laughs]
Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?
And that, uh, questionnaire.  Sorry to make you fill that thing out…
[hands David his papers] There you go.
How do you think you function here in New York?
You’ve been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam’s note] What have you liked most about that place?
Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So… long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?
[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?
The real reason that I went to Stamford… was because… I wanted to be… not here.
And even though… I came back, I just, I feel like I’ve never really… come back.
[phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I’ll transfer you.
Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
[to camera, tearing up, smiling] I’m sorry, what was the question?
[on phone, smiling] I’m excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
[still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]
Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Well, I don’t know what it’s gonna be called, but… my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future… is me.
Heart is.  That makes a lot more sense.  You think they’d help each other out like that at corporate? [Oscar shrugs] I think not!
Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he’s boss, it’ll be really awkward.
But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn’t feel the same way, and then he’ll be gone.
Yeah, well, you know, whatever happens. [Kelly puts her hand on Pam’s shoulder] Oh.
Oh, I know.  We talked about it and he told me.
Kelly made me realize something.  She and I have… nothing in common.  And I need more friends.
When an attacker goes through another country sometimes they wi…
Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative?
It is the source of all energy on this planet.
Wrong.  It is a corporation formed by aliens.
I’m a very good interviewee.  Why?  Because I have something that nobody else has.  And that is… my brain.  Which makes me charming, witty, intelligent… [long pause] and quick on my feet.
Trick question.  There was no second man on the moon.
Step 1, disinfection.  Step 2, incision.  Step 3, remove the appendix tenderly so it doesn’t burst and spread toxic…icity everywhere.
Step 5, [talking over Andy, indistinct] …the wound.
How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back.
You know generally it’s not a good idea to click on offers that you haven’t requested. What was the exact offer?
Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It’s really nice to be good friends again.
Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they’re just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]
I don’t know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They’ve been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
And Sunday I’m thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
Oh that sounds fun. I’m mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.
It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could… And she is going to be OK.
What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah… people have survived far worse.
No need we can just check the security tapes.
Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
Yeah, it’s only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.
Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
Hey guys, we’re all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we’re kicking in $5 for flowers.
No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.
She’s been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks… about Sprinkles.
I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
Can’t your other cats keep her company.
There’s bad blood, jealousies, cliques.
Angela, you’re the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn’t even be planning this, it’s your job.
So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?
So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.
Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.
No, I was being negligent. But she’s in the hospital, she’s fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in…
Did this happen on company property?
Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so… double jeopardy, we are fine.
I don’t think you understand how jeopardy works.
Oh, right, I’m sorry. What is: we are fine?
People keep calling me a “Wunderkind”; I don’t even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but… it’s a weird word.
Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
Check to see if she’s faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn’t crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.
OK, we’re leaving for the hospital at 1.
Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we’ll sign it outside her room.
Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
Ok, good good, so we’ll just all go down there together at lunch.
Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?
You can’t be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!
Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh… She looks like an angel.
No… OK, she always looks like that… That is not my fault.
OK… Meredith, [hauntingly] Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.
Brought you some balloons. Why don’t we… here you go. [wraps them around her IV] Tie these up, cheer up your tubes… [IV pops out] Oh! Shhhh… For God’s sake!
No don’t bother the nurse, just put it back in.
[groaning] I am going to be sick… I’m gonna puke.
I wouldn’t… I wouldn’t worry about it. Don’t touch it.
What, what are you doing? Just gimme that.
No, it’s not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.
Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What…
Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I’ll see you guys at the office.
Oh, OK… Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.
No, that’s not. That’s next to cleanliness.
Look, I just… I don’t understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.
Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it’s not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.
Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.
Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
Did she look… When you saw her how was she looking?
Really dead. Like a… just a dead cat.
So… Hey come on, don’t be sad, just… OK… just. She’s in a better place.
Actually the place that she’s in is the freezer, because of the odor.
OK, you know what? Everybody, let’s just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let’s just…
Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I’m not superstitious, but… I’m… I am a little-stitious.
Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?
Like park on it. Or dig up a body… Toby? Anything you want to tell us?
No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo’s Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so… uh, I got a week of free pies.
Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.
Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn’t ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
Dwight, you haven’t seen Meredith yet, have you?
Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
I do not respect her, but I will go.
Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
Oh, Michael, you can’t ask about religious beliefs…
Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.
Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let’s just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.
[puts hand up for high five] Same religion.
I’m a Lutheran and Bob’s a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
I’ve been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader.
Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.
Well if you’re going to reduce my identity to my religion then I’m Sikh, but I also like Hip-hop and NPR, and I’m restoring a 1967 Corvette in my spare time.
As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we’re using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what’s unethical.
Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
Um… I’m an intern, which makes me a doctor, but…
Pfft… Her chart doesn’t indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
Ah, so uh… so that is where her uterus went… Um, Ms. Palmer, your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago?
Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
It also says you were recently bitten by a raccoon?
You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. [sighs] And it’s not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn’t make any sense… God is dead.
If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?
No, no. You’ve gotta be bitten by something.
Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in… Lock jaw.
Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus’ dad?
Michael Scott’s Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
[on the phone] No, rabies… Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?
Come on man, gotta step it up! It’s for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
That… is for a good cause. Phyllis, how’s the rabies quilt coming?
Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
It is not a real charity. It’s stupid Michael, and I’m not gonna do it.
I know that you’re probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
I just don’t want to run. I didn’t bring my sneakers or my clothes.
Well, you’re going to have to run, or you’re going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.
[in bathroom] I’m petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So… I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple]
Hey Angela. Hey, um… I’m sorry about your cat. [Angela starts to cry]
Pssst. I’m having relationship problems. And since you’re always having relationship problems, I thought you’d be able to give me some advice.
I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.
When I got home, Sprinkles’ body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
Something’s not right. The vet’s doing an autopsy.
So what’s your strategy for this race?
Then I’m gonna run fast in the middle.
Why won’t more people do that? [laughs]
[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah… No that’s not… I mean that wasn’t, ah…
I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh… How it looks like um… I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um… anything.
Yeah, I gave him a ride home because…
Ah, yeah. We haven’t told anybody, but it’s going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?
You’re taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
[sighs] You’ll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
[pushes her chair into Dwight’s legs] I’m not depressed I’m in grief.
We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um… when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?
Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but… What do you think Michael, that’s over 25% of our funds?
Hmm… That’s a tough decision. Um… I always imagined it with a giant check. So…
Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
Well I don’t know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that’s what you told me when I contributed.
You didn’t contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how’s that been going?
Not well. A doctor won’t come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
You know what though, I’ve actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
Great, it’s gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah… oh actually more with tips.
Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith’s son.
Have you met that kid? He’s not going to college.
Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]
So I closed the door but the image of his…
[Michael knocks slowly on door] Come in.
See how I did that. That’s the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.
You couldn’t have taken off all your clothes in the men’s room?
Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.
On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.
European offices are naked all the time.
Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so…
I didn’t see where it started but I saw where it ended.
They say if you’re nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on… or a funny coat.
[naked from chest up] Oh, I’m sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
82 November first. How much is the prize money?
Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I’m Toby, I’m stretching, I know what I’m doing. Why is he even here?
So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
I don’t know what your deal is, but he’s mine, OK? So hands off.
[feeding a squirrel] I’m giving him a peanut.
No, don’t give him… just, did you hear anything I said?
He’s happy because he’s insane. You know what, that’s the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where’s the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse’s outfit] This is the reason we’re here.
Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.
Just remember folks, it’s not about winning, it is about finishing.
You’re doing great Michael, look at you go!
I am fast! I’m very fast! I’m like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. [Creed, Stanley, and Oscar get into a cab]
Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
I’ve walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. [running right behind Kevin]
Yeah. [laughs] Oh we’re in last place.
Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?
No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water… solidarity!
Rabies victims… have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So… least I could do.
[Creed, Stanley, and Oscar sitting at a table] Can we get another round?
So we’ve got what, another 20 minutes?
That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.
You’ve got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby’s coffee before the race.
[laughs] Excellent! …Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?
I’m makin’ great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.
I don’t know I’m really committed to winning.
OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that’s already been cured.
[Burp] Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I’m getting a stitch. [groans]
[runs into the back of Kevin] Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.
Well you look cute as a button. You’ve worked up quite a sweat.
The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don’t have the stomach to do.
It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It’s OK.
How could you do that without telling me?
I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don’t get there if you’re euthanized.
I know a great taxidermist. I’ll pay to have her stuffed. Well he’s not great, but he’s pretty good.
[runs by] Take bat bites seriously. Don’t get bit.
Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
Don’t touch me Dwight! [runs off crying]
[holding lamp] You like it? It’s kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.
[crosses finish line] And the winner is Toby Flenderson.
I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
[bent over] I am not going to finish. I can’t beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line]
What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or…
I can’t finish. I feel so weak, I just…
Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.
And Michael, you don’t have rabies. And chances are you’re not going to get it anytime soon. So… you don’t really have to think about it too much.
Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
Yeah, but there’s other, better people out there who are helping.
You just don’t think I am capable, of making a difference.
I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
It’s ironic isn’t it? I mean I’m in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you’re in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
I’m in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I’m not mad at you anymore.
Thanks, I’m not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share?
I’m not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I’m good.
Did you ever think of this?  Would a sober person walk in front of a car?
I’m sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?
That’s not what…no, no, I’m not saying that, that’s disgusting.
Drunk?  No!  You can’t get drunk off Kahlua.  It’s just a kind of coffee.
I am saying… that… maybe I was drunk.  Did you ever think of that?
Maybe she hit me.  You ever think of that?  She hit me?  I don’t know whose fault it was.  I wasn’t exactly looking at the road.
Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly’s cubicle]
Kelly, we’re going to visit Meredith at lunch.  [Kelly’s lying down on floor, head unseen under desk.  She rolls to her side, away from Pam]  Kelly?
Well, Kelly’s been so upset about Ryan dumping her, that she can’t even talk. [grins]
[from under desk]  I don’t want to talk to anybody about Ryan!  Please, go away!
They don’t have this kind of technology at the vet’s.  It’s not far.
You know what, why don’t go around the room and say one memory of Meredith.  I’ll start.  I liked her jumpers.  They reminded me of Kindergarten.  Jim?
I’ll always remember Meredith’s back.  That’s all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it’s Carrot Top, and he’s going to turn around and tell a joke.
So, how’s the view old girl?  [looking out windows]  Oh!  There’s a cemetery.  You think that’s affiliated with the hospital, or is it a like a separate feature…
Hey! Okay, okay, okay,    You can just close that.
Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.
See you guys. [chorus of goodbyes, all but Michael file out as he’s talking, Creed takes Meredith’s pills]
Let’s just… Why can’t you just forgive… Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?  How do you know that you weren’t born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?
I’m not going to leave until you forgive me.
[standing for a while, sighs, turns to walk out] Oh, okay.
Nurse!  I just need some water.  And my pills.  Thank you.
This office is cursed.  [sighs]  And we need to do something about it.
Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.  I’m just saying, at least right here [indicates floor in front of his office] is cursed.  Conference room, 10 minutes.
On the one hand, it’s a relief to know that it’s not just me, the whole office is cursed.  On the other hand, I may have to deal with the dark unknown.
Question: Has anyone recently offended a Gypsy?
We have to have done something wrong.
That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse.
I was raised Catholic, but I’m agnostic now, so I guess I’m a secular humanist.
Oh.  Great.  We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.
Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?
Yes.  It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.
My cousin Mose’s best friend was a dog.  One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead.  Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose’s cream pies.  Did I feel bad for killing him?  No.  That’s how you deal with a thief.
Oh, slow!  Oh, ho, ho, ho. [laughing as he passes Phyllis and Bob]  You guys are going so slow…
Oh, all right!  All right!  All right!  All right!
Okay! [Bob Vance and Michael in an all-out sprint, Michael grunting]
You’re gonna be just fine, Michael!  You’re gonna have a good life.
Lots of people suffer dehydration; they all recover just fine.
I’m Michael’s pediatrician.  Dehydration’s pretty simple.  He could also have been treated by a Boy Scout leader, a coach, or a, a… a water bottle.
Well, apparently, my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay.  I will be paying out-of-pocket.  Um… I kinda wish I’d been hit by a car.
Hey, doc?  You forgetting something? [pediatrician takes a lollypop from his pocket and gives it to Michael]  Thank you.
I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim]
I’m just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
No. Thanks… uh we’re still having lunch today, right?
I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.
Hey Toby. What’s this? [holds up memo Toby has passed out to the staff]
[reads memo] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
Yes, uh some people in the office have complained…
…about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know [Michael leans in closer to Toby] I just wanted to remind it’s not appropriate to, to do that.
[to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So…
[turns to address Jim and Pam] No way.
Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
Actually, we’ve been dating for a couple months.
I love you guys, so much. [hugs Jim]
Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]
Phone’s ringing. [goes back toward desk]
No, no, no Pam let ’em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is [starts to well up] really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.
I don’t see it. I think they both could do better.
It’s not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
Jim Halpert’s off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
Hey. Can you make that straighter? That’s what she said.
No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it]
[reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
Michael… [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress]
[reading sign] Oh, is… Ryan coming back today?
Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].
It’s a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I’m giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
And his name is… Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don’t you Garbage? [makes chomping noises]
I can’t believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she’s even in the ground.
Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he’s a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.
I don’t want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]
Hey… [sees both Jim and Pam] you two.
Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those ‘we’re dating’ things for the company.
Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know [makes quotes with fingers] relationships, so… if, if this is just a casual thing, there’s no need, really.
Well, I don’t wanna speak for Jim, but, it’s like pretty official. [Jim smiles]
Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or…?
Let’s just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?
[sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back —
Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It’s great to see you. Is Michael in?
There he is! There he is! He’s back! And he’s with a beard. [laughing] He… He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I’m Tubs.
Ohh, yeah, let’s get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..
Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.
[rubbing hands in Ryan’s hair] Fire!
Fire guy. Don’t start any fires, Ryan.
Fire guy [makes flames with his hands]
Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You’re like our little man…
…let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I’d like your respect. I am your boss now. You’re gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
That’s a little kinky. I don’t swing that way.
Woooo![laughs] I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let’s get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes?
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I’m not really sure what’s wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading “Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!”]
This is a massive overhaul. We’re getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
I’ll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
What if we don’t want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?
Any other questions? [Kelly’s hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
Can we speak privately about our relationship?
Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave]
That’s some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
You’re over 40, that’s the cut off. Are you listening to what he’s saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I’m telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we’re goners.
Swore I wouldn’t tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.
Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn’t say anything?
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
Sorry, I didn’t know you guys were in here.
And… that is why we waited so long to tell people.
Yeah, kay. I was just… After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
Well it is business, but not as usual.
Yeah, I know I understand… we’re making great strides and we’re updating, but business as usual, no?
No. [shaking head] We’re throwing out the entire playbook, we’re starting from scratch, we’re implementing a brand new system.
No. We’re not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
If the kid wants to set mine up, I’ll let him.
I can’t see half of the things. [adjusts glasses]
I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
Kelly, I’m your boss now, OK? You can’t keep talking to me like I’m your boyfriend.
Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don’t think you ever cared about me.
I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
Well, I hope you’re still committed because I’m pregnant.
And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.
Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
I can… I can’t talk about this right now, OK? After work, we’ll go out to dinner, we’ll talk about it then, OK?
Hello, Dwight. I’ve been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
I’ll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
Well, not exactly my job… I had a different title.
Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
Different salary. [laughs] You’ll get there, don’t worry.
You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael’s office]
[holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
I don’t want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
Oh, I dunno, they’re launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He’s being a real twerp about it, so, it’s all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
I hope he’s gets hit with an ageism suit.
So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black]
I’m thirty. Well, in November I’ll be thirty.
Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
Michael told us to wait in here. We don’t know why.
[notices pictures on the wall] Ohh… man.
Good, we’re all here, we can get started.
Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?
Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] ‘Scuse me. [closes door]
Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. [they glare at each other]
Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?
Well, I, I, I haven’t been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy.
Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.
I’m gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.
Back then, it was an uh, an industrial supplier of metal brackets mostly for, for construction.
And then Mifflin, of course he killed himself later… Uh, but I knew Mifflin through the Rotary Club.
And he was, he was [starts laughing] at dinner with Beverly and her husband, wha-what was his name, umm… uhh… Jerry.. Jerry Trupiano from, from South Jersey and he was tall. Both he and Mifflin were tall guys.
That’s great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
Well, cou, could you get me another… [Michael closes door]
Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, because it’s illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand]
I think that I should help him get home.
No, No. Don’t help him. He doesn’t need help, Pam. [Jim nods head and Pam gets up and leaves to help Robert Dunder, Michael shows Robert thumbs up] What a nice guy.
Good night guys. [staff leaves the office]
Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
I disagree, I think it was very valuable.
Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?
You know, some place romantic and expensive.
You know what, you’re right. I’m feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]
Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
Are you enjoying your mineral water?
I can’t do this. I can’t be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles’ stiff lifeless body.
Then don’t look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it’s an old sales trick.
I’m sorry. I gave this everything I could.
I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant]
Hey guys.  This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.
[under his breath] Nice to meet you.
[gesturing to the rest of the office] This is everybody else… okay… This is the place… so thanks for the lift.
Yeah, sure. I’ll, uh, I’ll see you tonight, right?
Absolutely. [Toby kisses Amy for an extended period of time, Pam and Jim are shocked]
Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  You’re going to violate your own PDA memo.
I wouldn’t want to do that now would I?
I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didn’t see it?  Did Jim say that I didn’t see it? I saw it!
We have a lot of colored paper here… why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall]
Yeah!  I know.  I know.  It’s bland.
Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
Like, something that you have to look for.  Sort of a “Where’s Waldo.” [screensaver box hits the corner of the screen]
[everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright.  Let’s quit while we’re ahead.
Some days I am just on fire.  What can I say?
I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so…
Well, I really appreciate you coming. I’m singling you ouuuut.
And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?
[lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?
[whispers] I’ll read this when I get home.
Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
And… today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.
The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company.  Wow!  Watch out Dwight.
That’s ridiculous.  I’m not going to be beaten by a website.
If that’s from Ryan, does it mention if he’s seeing anybody?
No.  It doesn’t.  I’ll find out tonight.
I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
Waste of time.  The website’s going to win.
Dwight mercy killed Angela’s cat.  It’s very complicated.  It’s caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I don’t want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
I told you I don’t want you doing these things in here.  You can use your own office or do it in the hall.
Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We’re going guerrilla.  We’re takin’ it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don’t want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin’ paper just became fun.
And this is where I will record your sales.
And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.
Ehh, can’t do that.  Really hard for me to let things go.
I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.
Isn’t 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
Lunch party?  It’s supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?
Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we’re gonna try out some new things today.
So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
I’m so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
It is awful.  You’ve made this day awful!
Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
Okay, wow!  Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And here’s $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots who’ll do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cat’s still dead.
Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner.
Okay.  We start.  As soon as I make… this shot.  Aaannnddd go!
Uhyeaahhh!  Hello, Susan?  Dwight Schrute.
What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
Today I’m prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
Yeah, I’m aware of that.  But he’s also being super annoying.  And I’m not a perfect person.
Three reams! Yoohoo… in your face, machines.
What kind of prank are you thinking?
What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  I’ll hold.
[dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
[on monitor] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
[on monitor] How do I know this isn’t Jim?
Setting up the web-cam for the party.
Oh good.  Okay cool.  How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?
Depends… how much have you eaten already today?
Uh, just one second.  We’re in a meeting and I’ll see if he’s available.  It’s Jan.
Why don’t you wanna go tonight?  What… all your friends are gonna be there.  It’ll be fun.
[on phone] My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.
Na… no.  No.  If I go by myself everybody will think I’m a big loser.
Do I have your permission to invite Carol?
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.  It’s just the first… girl that popped into my head.  I’ll find somebody I haven’t slept with.
Three-oh-five.  You my friend are winning handsomely.
Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty.
You my friend are in a very close second.
Okay, uh why don’t you just lay off, lady?
What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins.
Alright.  Well fight it out amongst yourselves.  I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
[on monitor] Here’s a suggestion computer.  I assume you read…
Here’s a suggestion computer.  I assume you read binary so why don’t you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.
Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.
I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.
I want to understand what you’re saying but it’s difficult for me when you use that tone.
Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?
What are you doing?  I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, “Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.”
Damnit Kelly!  It knows!  It knows what you did!
Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin’ multiple reams like a man.
Y… You don’t understand. If… okay, if this makes the difference, I’m gonna tell it that you were responsible.
I am not a bad person.  When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them.  What did I intend to do with them?  Who knows?  Maybe keep them as a souvenir.  Maybe use them.
Yes, Mr. Galliado.  How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you’re paying right now?  It’s not important how I got your information.  What is important is that you say yes.  Good.
Alright.  I’m ready to go and I’m callin’ shotgun.
Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
Because there’s a party! A party for the website I’ve been planning for two weeks.
If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow.
Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
[on monitor] Oh.  I didn’t realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples.
I’m sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I… yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?
Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women’s shelter?
You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham]
Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places You’ll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured…
It’s not.  It’s different.  But it’s a good book.
You guys should come over for dinner.  You and Pam.  That’d be fun.  Friday?
Oh, no cause… you’re gonna let me know when we’re close, right?
Yes.  Actually I will tell you right now.  It’s a club called Chatroom, and there’s a password to get in, which is actually password.  So…
Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
Are there, uh, three w’s at the beginning of the address?
You know what this is like?  I’ll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn’t let any of the Seniors go.
Doesn’t it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it’s path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams.
Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again.
Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.
How do you tell someone it’s over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.
[on monitor] You beat me.  You are the superior being.
Ohhh, what?  Oh I think I faked Oscar out.
You said you weren’t coming back and we could leave early.
I think I faked Stanley out too.  Who else thought that I was leaving?  And they could all go home early?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Well who needs New York?  Right?  We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
Nope nope nope no.  This is going to be nothing like the party you’ve been planning.  This is going to be good and everybody’s gonna come.  What’s wrong with Dwight?
Oh hey!  Good for you.  Good for you.  Scranton power.  Alright you know what?  Angela I’d like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on.  Good.
Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen.
Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?
Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel.
Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important…
I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, “Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?”
Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldn’t say that if I didn’t hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this?
No seriously.  Is there anyone else who could do it better?  Because we don’t have a lot of time.  I’ll get the pizza!
No, not like that, as a woman.  W-O-M-A-N.
I hear she’s single and ready to mingle.  I’m thinking about making a play for her.  What do you think?  Crazy, right?
I think it’s inappropriate to date someone you work with.
She works here too, how is that any different?
Uh, she works in the annex.  You’re also welcome to date Toby.
Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
Wait! Alfredo’s Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?
You know what?  I don’t understand when you all talk at the same time.
Michael, there’s a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
Okay, okay, what’s better?  A medium amount of good pizza?  Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?
Oh no, it’s bad.  It’s real bad.  It’s like eating a hot circle of garbage.
You can pick one of these things.  It’s unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
[Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela’s face]
Are you looking for dinner and a movie?  Because you’re not going to find it in that box.  [Camera pans to Kevin giving an “are you kidding me?” look]
Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box.
Angela, are you hearing words that I’m saying?
They say you should never mix business with pleasure.  Really?  Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.
Hey.  Sixty-three fifty, and that’s not including tip.
Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
The half off coupon only applies to orders of two pizzas.
Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.
I don’t care what you told them on the phone, that’s our policy.
You didn’t actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
Okay, it doesn’t say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it’s policy, it should say it on the coupon.
[sarcastic shrugging of shoulders] What do you mean hmm-um?
It is your problem.  That’s no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.
Great story.  It’s sixty-three fifty, and that’s not including tip.
Well then you’re not getting you’re pizzas.
No, no you’re not going anywhere.  You’re staying here until we figure this out.
Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.
No, you don’t even know what stupid is.  It’s about to get all stupid up in here.
We think it’s a straight forward kidnapping.
Stanley, could you look up “accomplices”?
I’ve seen this kid before. He’s one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
Yeah, I know that guy.  He’s that farmer that grows really crappy weed.
You ready to give me my discount now?
Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?
We’re a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.
Alright, Dwight, knock it off.  You better think about what you are doing young man.
You better think about what you’re doing.
Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked that’s called sales.
Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
I’m not kidnapping him, I’m keeping him until I get what I want.
Listen up kid.  [pops balloon with his hands]  I don’t like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.
Why are you looking at her like that?
Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
Mister Overdramatic, what’s up Kevin?
We’re getting hungry out there.  We’re all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo’s Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
That’s why you’re not in charge Meredith.
Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.
It’s just ice, it’ll melt all over the floor.
Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes.  You just have to wave and introduce yourself.
I’ll just wave and introduce myself.
Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you’re never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.
You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there’s no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you’re about to eat has expired.
That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
Wow, can we make it a different moment?
Can I start talking?  Is this thing on?  Give me a signal when you want me to start.
And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that [bleep]hole.
Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
If anyone out there is listening, I’m being held here against my will.  I’m a minor.
Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I’ve repulsed you, but I like you.
So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she’s giving off fairly strong vibes that she’s not interested.
But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can’t back down.
[kicks open bathroom door] If you’re going number one you’ve got ten more seconds!
I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
I’m just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you’re going to do something to him.
Shut up, or I’m going to punch you in the throat!
Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.
You had to, what other choice did you have?
Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
You’re breaking up. I can’t hear you.
Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he’s being held against his… [Michael hangs up on Ryan]
[to Dwight] Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.
Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There’s two more.
Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
Alright.  Oh, I assume I’m going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
Not now Dwight, please, it’s not the time.
A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.
[answers two ringing phones] Hello, hey hang on a second.  Hello, hang on.
I don’t know yet, I have to call you back.
I have to go clean up after the party.
Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.  I’d really like some sushi.  I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today.  And you know what?
Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.
I’m sorry, you guys are going to have to leave.
Hey, you know what? [Michael and Dwight grab plates of sushi] Come on, come on, let’s go.
Oh, thanks.  This is the guy that beat the computer.
Oh, very cool.  It was funny to see Ryan all embarrassed by that.
[mocking Ryan] I’m Ryan, and tonight didn’t go the way that I thought it would, because it didn’t work out for me, and I’m very embarrassed.  I got egg all over my face.
And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
I never sold any paper, because I’m an idiot.
I started a fire with my cheese pita.
Now I’ve got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I’m your boss.
And I’m hot, I’m so hot. That’s why everybody…
I don’t get that, I don’t understand that.
Well, it’s part of it, it’s just the… uhhh.
[steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]
[Dwight come into office unshaven]  What?
Well it’s just that you had no hair on Friday.
It’s called being a man.  You should try it sometime.
That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.
[to Dwight] What do you think of Angela?  There’s just something about her.  All that strength and steeliness and righteousness all wrapped up tight and shoved into a tiny little delicate frame.
I want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me. [Pam stares and nods]  Don’t avoid this.  I know you’re dying to say it, so just say it.
Sometimes your laziness borders on incompetence.
What, no.  No.  Okay, bags.  I have bags under my eyes, Pam.  I didn’t see it at home, I didn’t see it in the bathroom, I didn’t see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light…
[interrupting] The city mirrors, or the…?
The big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?  The big round things.
The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?
Yes.  I have bags under my eyes, and I can’t go to New York like this!  What do I do?  What do I do?
All right!  Martha Stewart!  You can be Martha Stewart’s receptionist!  Very good!  I will be tea baggin’ it.  Nn… no.
I’m a little mad, that I don’t get to go to the party in New York.  But that’s mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.
I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel.  Because Angela’s party is mandatory.
I go to New York all the time, to visit my buddy Frank.  He’s a mole person.
Uh… something cool that Ryan doesn’t know about yet.
How am I supposed to know what that is?
I don’t know, but standing here’s not going to give you the answer.  Go.
Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the person’s will, so Michael asported him. [giggles]  Have you ever been aspor…
In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don’t know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza.
The lady cop acted like she’d never pulled someone over for driving too slow.  And I tried to get out of it with the famous Toby Flenderson 10,000 watt smile. [smiles] It didn’t work.
Because we’re not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work.
Because yesterday when I was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate.
Just reiterating what you said to me.
You know the octagon sign means stop.
An octagon is a shape.  You can see shapes, can’t you?
It’s out of context.  It’s not the same as driving.
He’s a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn’t be surprised that he’s identified with her character.
Like the main company number? Because I’m gonna have to call information.
Where’s Armani? He’s on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I’m so much better than you are. [breaks into laughter]
Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won’t ruin it for you.
Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what’s best for you, Mo Chuisle.
Mo Chuisle. He’s watching Million Dollar Baby… He’s gonna try to kill me.
So this one goes with my eyes and this one goes with your eyes. People have said I have very pretty eyes.
I haven’t heard the same about you. So let’s just go with mine.
Well, they both go with the carpet I’ve ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
It… folds up. You’ve only seen it flat.
I— Ok. How much is this going to cost?
No— don’t… that doesn’t even mean anything.
It’s just that you say it’s gonna cost what it costs— [phone rings]
[on the phone] Michael, it’s Ryan for you.
Conniving little runt. Put him through.
[on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.
I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.
Hold on, I’ll get them on the phone.
[looking at nothing] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.
[talking on phone] Sure, I can hold.
Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
Does the Department of Health know about this?
I’m not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.
Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.
It says here you cater to the eldery.
Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That’s what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you’ll ever see.
We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you’ll be interested in, um, Mose’s table making demonstration?
So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
Why? Improv? Why don’t you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
Use to have two cars, traded ’em in, now we’re down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.
One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.
No I left it on my night table— your night table, by the lamp.
You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn’t see it there.
The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it’s so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
You can not, I have a thing tonight.
That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.
Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.
You wouldn’t understand. It’s a secret.
You wouldn’t understand, Jim. It’s a secret.
I can’t believe this place is real. I mean, I’ve heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!
I don’t know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car]
I just love sales. I love it to death. It’s as simple as that. And I don’t get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.
Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.
We’re a legit operation with a license from the city I can show you. We pay minimum wage against commision—
No, they’re with me, so… this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!
We have three rooms, each with a different theme.
American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.
I’ll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
Everybody in the conference room. In 5 minutes.
I just want to remind you to stick to the script. Improving the work. So, make the call, say the lines, make the sale. Got it?
We’re offering a $50 bonus tonight to the guy with the most sales. Ok.
You could make jokes when you’ve made a sale there rookie, ok? [laughter ends]
Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the— Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
I’m just calling because you responded positively to the—
Why are you calling me here at home?
[Spanish accent] Senor, are you happy with your—
Michael, I know that’s you. Why are you calling me here at home?
[speaking with a different voice] Have you— Have you considered satellite television?
Michael, I know that’s you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]
[on the phone] When I’m at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
Well your son sounds like he’s really motivated. I think it’s crazy the coach won’t play him frankly.
Just dial the number on the sheet and stick to the script. Say those words exactly, got it? I don’t know why we have to keep on having this conversation.
Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes—
A few more minutes is a waste of our time.
You give a quick pitch. You make the sale. You move on. That’s how Vikram does it.
Vikram doesn’t have my people skills.
Good for Vikram, because he out-sells you every night.
Well, I hope this conversation has helped.
Oh it looks like mixed masala, eggplant, and rice.
Oh, and what about you? Peanut butter flavor again?
I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
Wonder what I would’ve been back home?
I know, but it’s competitive here. What’s a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
I would’ve been chief of surgery… Or a cowboy.
[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you’re going up there?
[Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this?
Dude, you should review movies. [other co-workers agree]
[Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn.
[Jim knocks on Dwight’s door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
Is everything satisfactory with your stay?
Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
Oh. Well I’ll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]
Yeah, so we’re all gonna go out for a beer. Do you wanna come?
Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.
Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin’?
I’m gonna have it one of these nights.
Well if you concentrate and make your calls faster, yeah.
Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?
I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in]
Hey guys! What’s happening? How’s my favorite branch doin’?
Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
Um… that wasn’t much of an introduction.
Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.
Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we’re gonna be talking… about…PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!
Yes I forgot about Ryan’s presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.
Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
You didn’t prepare a presentation at all, did you?
No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.
What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one’s business but mine and my other business’.
You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. [Kelly laughs]
Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
It’s not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn’t information you need.
There’s information here? Yeah, you’re right, I don’t need this.
How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
Why don’t you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?
You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
No, whomever is never actually right.
Michael is right. It’s a made-up word used to trick students.
No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.
Obviously it’s a real word, but I don’t know when to use it correctly.
I know what’s right, but I’m not gonna say, because you’re all jerks who didn’t come see my band last night.
Do you really know which one is correct?
It’s ‘whom’ when it’s the object of a sentence, and ‘who’ when it’s the subject.
It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.
To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.
No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever’s name is Toby, why don’t you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
Wait! This doesn’t matter. And I don’t even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you’re fired here.
I’ve never done this before. I’ve never quit anything in my life.  So, you are filming history.
Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs.  One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company—
And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.
In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me.  But the truth is, I can’t do this.
Come back anytime, don’t forget to disinfect your headset.
Me.  All night.  Dreaming about Angela’s smoking hot body.
Not from a male perspective.  You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she’s looking, and she’s totally not responding to my moves.
I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.
Um, I don’t know if I really see you two together.
Really?  Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.
Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.
Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.
Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.
Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldn’t do that to Dwight… or Angela… or Andy.
Hey Kevin, you’re a gambler right?  A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.
Okay, um, Oscar, I’m going to need to take another advance on my salary.
What do you mean you have plans tonight?
I have my daughter tonight; we’re renting Charlotte’s Web.
Well, you have to make a choice, it’s either your daughter, or me.
Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.
[makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]
He’s always been terrible with money.
I bet it’s Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
I can’t believe he has a second job.
He’s not even good at his first one.
What’cha talking about?  [camera pans to each face in the break room]  Okay, I know what’s going on.  You’re talking about Jim and Pam, if they’re having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think—
Michael, are you having money problems?
Monkey problem? No, I’m not having monkey problems.  Why would I have monkey problems?
What’s going on, why do you have a second job?
I don’t have a second job.  Maybe I’m having an affair with Suzanne Summers.
I don’t talk to my girlfriend about money.  It is rude, and unsexual.
True, it’s best to hide our money problems from women.
I totally agree with you.  But I don’t have money problems, I don’t.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket]
You just put it back in your pocket.
Yeah, but I destroyed it, it’s not even useable anymore.
It’s like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It’s gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
Well, I just need to know where this is going.
Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what’s not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing’s run its course.
Don’t you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I’ve ever met in my entire—
Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I’ve ever met.  I mean, who says exactly what they’re thinking?  What kind of game is that?
Hey cuz, heard you’re having money problems.
Listen, I’ve got the answer.  You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.
Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy.  When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider.
How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.
You don’t go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts.  Nobody just picks up “get out of jail free” cards, those things cost thousands.
Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature’s do-over.  It’s a fresh start, it’s a clean slate.
Like the witness protection program.
I’ve always wanted to be in the witness protection program.  Fresh start, no debts, no baggage.  I’ve already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton.  I’m a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.  That’s the life.
Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can’t just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she’s using them as if I’m made of money, she thinks I’m a human ATM machine.
Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.
Oh, that’s the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.
Twelve hundred dollars.  What’s a Core Blaster Extreme?
I left a little present for Angela.  I think she’s going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together.  I got game.
Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
How do they do this so fast?  Is this power-point?
Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background]  Angela.
Michael, I’m going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.
We will find another way, we’ll ask power-point.
Michael, this is a presentation tool.
You’re a presentation tool if you think I’m gonna tell Jan about this.
No you’re not! Ok, just… you’re not a tool. Look, we’ll tell her that it’s bad, but it could’ve been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.
Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?
We wrote a good review.  Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
Table making never seemed so possible.
You will never want to leave your room.
The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
So due to Michael’s clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
Um, that’s, how did you get that from what Oscar’s saying?
[on phone] Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don’t, I don’t get this.  I really don’t.  I don’t know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don’t know what more to say.
[on phone] Well, is he coming right back?
What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I’m getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.
[to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
[incoherent mumbling] No you didn’t.
Yeah, I didn’t think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
[sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]
Hey, I was thinking about dinner— [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]
Ah, dinner.  Let’s see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
Jim’s just really passionate about Italian food.
Yep, I’m very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I’m in love with Italian food.
[singing] Runaway train, never come back.  Runaway and I’m never coming back.
Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?
I told you, no more answers.  This is who I am now.  A guy on a train with no answers.  I hope that can be enough for you.
Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won’t solve anything.  You know that.
Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It’s not that bad.
Yeah it is, it is.  I really messed up.
I’m keeping them. I know you like them. They’re kind of uncomfortable though.
It’s kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time.  They would say things like “don’t pay for six months” or “you can transfer your account from another card”…
Do you think I’ll get any new ones?  I could… [pause, eventually looks up at Dwight]
Were you listening to what I was saying?
All right, well, go find some.  Get outa here, please. [Dwight sighs and leaves]
Okay, you need to focus, Michael.  You need to stop spending money.
I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?
My CDs are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called Case Logic
And, um the Case Logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car.  There is another smaller Case Logic portfolio clipped to my visor [Oscar vigorously shakes his head]  What?
I’m asking about Certificates of Deposit.
I’ve been putting money into CDs for years.  I bought music that I didn’t even like.  No. [shakes head]
I don’t know if I can do that.  I can’t see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.
All right, well then maybe there’s another way, you know?  I mean, we could just… we’ll think of something else.
We will?  I can’t.  I don’t have an idea in my head.
[laughs] I am not going to tell you yet.
Well, please?  I won’t tell anybody.
Gentlemen, a word.  Look, you guys are my closest friends in this office.
I am dying of lovesickness and horny-sickness.
That is impossible.  Unless you mean gonorrhea.
I’m talking about Angela, okay?  Did you hear what she was saying to Pam the other day?
Yes, I did, ‘cept I don’t think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she’s in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So… best to just lay off.
No can do.  I am itching all over with Angela-pox.
Hey, Andy!  Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system.
I still do not have your reimbursement check.
That’s not why I came over.  I mean it’s a week late, but… I just came over to say hi.
Scranton U. Varsity’s gonna scrimmage the J.V. squad.  Should be pretty interesting.  J.V. gets really amped.
Well, I guess it’s a big opportunity for them.
Andy, no. [Andy nods and starts backing away, Kevin giggles]
Pam!  You don’t think he’ll mind if we take the shampoo, do you? [holds up large bottle]
[Mose serves bacon] Thank you, Mose.
There’s no other… way to get rid of the food.
Mose, Angela hasn’t been around here much lately, has she?
Angela – she used to stay here sometimes?
[on trampoline] Cannonball! Lemon bomb!  Jim, Pam, watch!  Jim, Pam, watch!  Jim, Pam, watch!
Name’s Mose, buddy!  Dwight, can I stop?  They’re not even looking.
Yeah, go ahead and stop.  You guys, you should really be looking, he’s working his ass off over here.
I’m sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show?
Arr, dammit!  [throws saw at table he was working on]
Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!
Best ad ever. [sings in the tune of the “Kit Kat theme song”] Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that… I am totally blanking. What is the thing?
[singing] Break me off a piece of that… huh huh huh… br- applesauce.
Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don’t think…
Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
Okay, it’s football cream. It’s football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?
I’m taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.
You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.
All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.
I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The ‘Nard Dog. Who let the ‘Nard Dog out?
He gives the best back rubs in the office.
It’s true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy [makes farting noise]. Not! You just got ‘Nard dogged!
Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.
Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn’t have points or scores, it doesn’t have winners or losers.
Okay I can tell that your time is valuable—
Actually I don’t get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so…
That all sounds really, really ambitious.
Why don’t we show you what we did with the Nashua branch?
Mmm. Okay. [commercial plays on laptop, peppy music in background]
That’s what Nassau came up with? That sucks! [chuckles] Whoa.
Well the main part of the ad has to stay the same, actually.
Yeah, it’s the last five seconds where we have some leeway.
Well, no, no. You don’t have to be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping. Sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. This is where you really get to be creative.
We cannot talk about this… because, someone might hear us.
Angela can stay the same, but we’ll change Andy to Dwight.
[on speakerphone, Eddie Murphy voice] Shrek! Shrek, I’m a donkey! I’m a donkey, Shrek! [laughing] I’m just kidding. It’s me. Hello Ry.
Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.
I told you not to call about small problems.
Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don’t like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
That’s good. They’re creative, you’re not.
It’s not part of your job, it’s like, maybe you can cook but it doesn’t mean you should start a restaurant.
Well actually I can’t cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike’s Cereal Shack. I’m thinking we’ll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
Okay, I’m not really interested in that right now. I’m delegating creativity to creative professionals. It’s a different skills set. Look, I wasn’t good at sales, right?
But I’m good at managing people who do sales .
Are you? I don’t think you’re doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.
Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.
Okay I’m not going to argue with this guy. Let’s go. Good luck dude.
[on phone] Michael, David Wallace.  What is this about dismissing the ad people?
Yeah, I’m glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.
I’m willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
Okay. [hangs up phone] And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.
Has anyone ever come up to you and said, “You’re not creative”?
Well they’re wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
Who are you talking to, specifically?
I kind of know what it’s like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]
When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
I’m excited about doing the ad, but I’m not really used to doing videos with so many people around.
[gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She’s doing a book signing right now.
Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.
Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?
Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she’s Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?
I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
[singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there’s friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
Call Michael or Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs.
Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought… I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.
Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I’ll make you a mix.
News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
Oh, it’s just my avatar guy. Whatever.
He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
Not much, it’s just for tracking Dwight so—
Right… you’re a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
I… why don’t we go back to this animation.
No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.
Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.
You’re right, it’s better than you! It’s us! [sings] Dunder Mifflin.
No, I hate it! I hate it! …I don’t hate it, I just don’t like it at all. And it’s terrible.
You’re on your own, Mike. [gets up and starts to walk away]
Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.
[singing] Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.
Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.
Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don’t get this, if we don’t nail it, we’re going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?
[crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton’s book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn’t supposed to take no for an answer.
So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?
Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? [Kevin hands her piece of tape]
I hope you’re not killing yourself on this, because I’m sure it’s good enough for Michael’s ad that will probably be seen by no one.
Maybe, but it’s not good enough for me yet.
Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I’m pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I’m sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.
I’m about to send the ad to corporate… and it is sent. They’ll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay. [dials phone]
Certainly. [makes beeping noises] Okay, clear.
They could call at any second now. [sighs] Oh God…I better call.
[Ten days later] Well, it’s been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!
[watching ad] Oh! [clapping and cheering]
No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It’s not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.
Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director’s cut. Hope you like it.
Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam]
Hey listen, you ever been on a motorcycle?
That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!
[singing] Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet. [speaking] It’s gotta rhyme with “piece.” Fancy Feast! [sings] Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It’s the cat food. Nailed it.
All right! So, anybody else? No bad ideas. Everybody, let’s keep ’em coming… oh, God.  Okay, Toby?
Well, you know how everyone fast forwards through ads these days? Well, what about an ad in slow motion. You know, if they fast forward through it, it’ll just seem normal and it will catch your eye. Plus, uh, the slogan could be:
There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.
I spent three years in advertising before I came here.
Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos.
Cool. Cool, I just wanted to make sure you got it.
Yeah, I get all the memos. [starts to leave]
And if not we can just make him disappear. [walks quickly over to Jim’s desk] This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don’t you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.
That’s, that’s a pirate movie. [Jim stares at Michael] That’s annoyed. Well, he doesn’t do very well under pressure.
[shakes head] Yeah… no.  [Jim turns to Pam with an exaggerated sad face; Pam laughs. Dwight walks towards Michael and the ad men]
And anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace.  Follow me!  Let’s get this movin’. [Dwight goes back to his seat, embarrassed]
All right!  [sitting down behind Michael’s desk] I’m not sure what I’m supposed to be doing, but…
You are my producer, you are a suit.  I am the creative genius.  You take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.
Now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a Sam Goody gift certificate…
…and we need to be done by 9 A.M. tomorrow.
Mmmhmm.  Why don’t you start by telling me what you got.
We start on a single blank sheet of paper.
And we widen to reveal ancient Rome.
Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman’s womb.
Okay, Scott, why don’t you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.
If you don’t let me pursue my artistic vision, I am going to walk!
Good!  Fine!  I’ve got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee… [dialing phone]
I can do it good.  I can do it good.  Please, don’t.  Please.  [kneels in front of desk] Please give me it.
[taps on desk and starts to leave his office] Do you want this open or closed?
Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]
Hey, everybody, I just got off the phone with David Wallace, and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever Dunder Mifflin television commercial.  Huh?
I can’t hear you! [less applause]  Heard you a little bit less that time.  Must be…
Actually, I’m a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a… celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.
Michael is on a mission to prove that he’s creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I’ve ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.
Thanks Ro.  Hey, we finally connected.  How’s Scranton?
I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch.  Turns out it’s a pretty easy gig when your boss isn’t an idiot and your boyfriend’s not in love with somebody else.
Look, All I’m saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we’d love to have you come aboard.  So think about it, okay?  Okay, bye.
Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?
I won’t need to because we’ll be together playing hooky.  Yeah.
I don’t understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I’m going to take it.
Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.
No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.
Oh, I don’t think that is what’s happening.
Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?
I think it’s because of my sales record.
Yeah we all want money.  But there is none in the budget, so… Tell me why you’re really leaving.
Mo money mo problems, Stanley.  You of all people should know that.  Let me ask you this, if I were-
Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don’t forget the flatware.
Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
So tell me again why I can’t be part of your club?
Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
Yes, listen, um…  You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.
I’m pretty sure his family’s coming with him.
No, his work family.  Look, this is very hard for me, but I’m going to give you my best man.  You may have Toby.
You can train him.  He’s very very smart, and funny, and charming… You know, I can’t do it, Toby is the worst.  That- that was a bluff, um…  Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I’m going to poach one of yours.
Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?  [Karen hangs up]
I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.
I’m going to cut right to the chase here.  Do you like magic?  Because I’m a genie in a bottle, and I’m going to grant you three wishes.  To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.
Aren’t you the guy that hit the woman with your car?
[to Pam] Get out. [to Ben] Uh, yeah.  I also saved her life, but I guess that’s not as grabby.
Everyone says Scranton branch is worse than Camden.  Didn’t everyone from Stanford quit, like immediately?
No, I fired them, and your next. … So what do you say?
What is that guy talking about?  Scranton is not lame.  Scranton is the cool, fun branch.  We’re like Animal House.
Jim, we’re getting crapped on.  Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.
What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, that’s what we’re going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples.
Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we’re going to crush this sale.  We’re going to prove, what the hell is that music?
That’s the problem, that’s the problem.  We need rock n’ roll Pam, rock n’ roll.  Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh… My… God, that’s why people are leaving.  I- I have no words.
We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?
Well, gee, Jim, I don’t know, I guess there’s no sales call today.
We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we’re doing.
We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.
I can’t believe you guys.  I’m not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!
[throws Jim’s cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha!
No communication with the outside world Jim.
It had to be done, it had to be done.
Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother’s new baby on it, so…
You know what?  I’m just going to call a cab from here.
Alright, you’re going to miss the best prank ever.
Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
Follow me, come here.  Here’s what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.  I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it’s going to be so badass.
Are you kidding me?  We’ve been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
Teach her to offer Stanley more money.
So the deal was, Dwight doesn’t blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.
So, why did you and Karen break up?  Was it the sex?
I can’t imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is…
Why don’t we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
Okay, I will start.  Um, “A.” [singing] “A” my name is Alan, and my wife’s name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell…  Damn it! What do we sell?  Um…
I’m trying to think of what we could sell.
Ah, la, la, la. What is that?  That sound…  The air-conditioning leaking or something?
That doesn’t make sense, couldn’t be.
What is that?  Dwight, are you peeing?
Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!
Well you said that we couldn’t make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
I know right?  I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.
And spend time with George Emerson.  That’s what I would do.  I mean it’s the best male protagonist we’ve read, right?
[joins them at the table] Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit.
Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel.  Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin’ delicious Pam.
Uh, I’m sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.
The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office.  Naturally, it’s where I need to be.  The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin’s band is my safety.
Fine.  I’ll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book.  Which just happens to be the very same book you’re reading.
Alright, just know that you’re not in the Finer Things Club.
I can’t believe we’re here, I can’t believe this is happening.
No, Michael.  I’m not leaving the car.
Yeah, Dwight, here’s how it’s going to go down.  You and I-
You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers.  And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
Then I’ll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?
Oh my God, that’s her! That’s her, go, go, go.
Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we’ve ever done.
It just- [Kevin banging and shaking the snack machine]  To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh…
Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background]
And George, his- his youthfulness.  His, um, freedom.  [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um…  What are you microwaving!?
Why don’t you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?
Someone needs to clean it.  It smells like popcorn.
So, Stanley, are you really outta here?
I’m gonna miss you man, you’ve been like an uncle to me.  Like a kind old uncle Remus.  I wanna stay in touch.
[from the walkie-talkie] We are in a stairwell.
[from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs.
Okay, you know what?  You don’t need to be updating me as much as you’re updating me.
There’s a security guard coming by.  Hello, we’re warehouse workers.  Would you like more proof?
Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.
I can see the security guard’s eyes.
Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
We found something far better, their crown jewel.  Their industrial copier.
It’s enormous, but it’s got wheels.  We’re wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.  Get the car ready, keep the engine running.
No, that is a terrible idea, don’t do this.
We’re wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg!  Jim leave us.
Don’t leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
Dwight, could you move over a little bit.
Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.
Just say you wanna get back together.
It doesn’t have to mean anything.  Just, do it for Stanley.  Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley.  Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.
You good?  I’m just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so…
Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good.
Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?
Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
So you’re still doing this kind of stuff, huh?
If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.
Oh no, I didn’t want to see you.  Not that I’m not happy seeing you, right now, I’m just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I’d say it was equal.  So, good to see you…
I mean, it’s just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn’t want to see… you…
[slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome.  I’m going to go because of, um, traffic.
Traffic, yeah.  Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm.
I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
I wasn’t really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.
I’m so sorry, Rolando told me everything.  How humiliating.  Would it help you to return to another age?  A time of refinement, and civility.
Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
[Irish accent] Angela’s Ashes, top o’ the morning to us.  Frankie’s prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
Okay, did you get it out of your system.
Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.
What was fun about it for you?  Was it the death of the twins?
And let me just add, that as a member of The Finer Things Club, I would bring a strong financial contribution to any discretionary funds that we may have.  Finally, here is a recommendation from former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum.
Okay, that’s enough, uh.  Thanks, Andy.
Oh, my God.  His letter of recommendation from Rick Santorum is three fifty-dollar bills.
Wow.  Now we can afford hard-cover books.
I like it just us three.  [very quietly] I don’t want it to change.
I love The Finer Things Club.  My ex-wife used to have a book club, and I would read their book and sometimes listen from the kitchen.
The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee.  Renegade clubs are dangerous.  I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group.  They didn’t need to gather.  It was just gross.
[slurping her from her big cup] I don’t know why I’m not in The Finer Arts Club [slurring].  It’s bullcrap. [throws her cup on the floor, something splashes on the camera]  You clean it up.
Utica is snoozeville, um, Albany are the prepsters, Nashua, no parking, um, Akron is haunted, Camden… is in a basement, Yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in Scranton, we are the cool guys.
Yes, I am, but I want shotgun for you.
No, Dwight!  Dwight, Jim is sitting next to me.  You’re gonna sit in the back left  where I don’t have to see your ugly moongob.
Okay, that is so mean!  You know what, I’m not going.
I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.  Dwight, you’re handsome.  You’re a very handsome man, get in the car.
[on phone] So, there was no sales call.
Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it.
Wait, you’re going along with this now?
I have to.  Pam, if I’m not there, someone’s going to go to jail.  Or die.
Right.  And, you wouldn’t be able to talk to Karen.
Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.
Well, yeah I don’t want to see her get physically harmed, that’s for sure.
Because you love her?  [baby voice]  Because you love her very much?
Okay.  Have fun with your girlfriend!
I’m kidding around.  We joke about that stuff all the time.  I’m not really the jealous type, so, I don’t care if Jim sees Karen.  I care a little.
They sprayed me in the eye. [Dwight and Michael are trapped by/under a copier in the stairwell]
[moans] Scranton rules! [sprays Silly Spray]
Dwight!  Stop it!  [moans]  Can you help me please, I’m being crushed.
Would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room?  Like I begged you to?  Pam would have understood.  Heck, Pam would have done it.
Yeah.  We shoulda brought Andy.  I cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.
Oh, it wasn’t camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat. [Michael walks in]
Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a “get to know you” weekend. Michael wasn’t invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.
Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come.
Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs]
Michael wasn’t invited on Ryan’s camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn’t go. He wasn’t invited.
Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s’mores, that I finally had to say, “No more s’mores, no more s’mores.” [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room]
Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience [Michael knocks on the window behind Toby from outside]
[from outside] Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.
Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? [Jim makes a face] Not real.
So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?
When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
Oh, can’t go today, ’cause I’m donating blood.
How often can you actually donate blood?
Your body only has a certain amount.
Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.
A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s’mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands]
Hello, I’m Broken Mountain. You know, here’s the thing. That’s not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself—
In the wilderness. It’s not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It’s one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.
I’m sick of it Jim. I’m sick of this place.
OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.
OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. [Dwight comes back with set of knives] Hey, what…
Let’s see if any of these will work. [clears the front of Michael’s desk]
Hey, hey hey! Dwight. [Dwight rolls out an assortment knives]. Dwight.
Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.
Do you want me to ask where you’re going?
Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.
Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.
This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.
When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.
Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let’s put it this way:
No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
Well, yes I would. And I would survive.
I would make sure that you were dead.
First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
You… you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK.
I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can’t retrace my steps. I don’t know what streets we’ve been— [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?
It would be better if you were unconscious.
No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it.
Do you want to do this right or not?
Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?
Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed’s birthday.
Oh, wasn’t it just someone’s birthday?
Yes. Kelly’s was last week, remember?
It’s birthday month. Creed’s is today. Oscar’s is week after next. Meredith’s is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers…
You know what, I have an idea. Why don’t we just do one big shared party?
There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
[flashback to Stanley’s birthday] Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.
And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to “Happy Birthday.” And he’s a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
[flashback to Kelly’s birthday, hiding in the elevator] Happy Birthday!
Ahhh!! [drops the papers she was holding]
[flashback to Oscar’s birthday, hiding in the break room] Happy Birthday!
Ahhh! [runs into door and Michael laughs]
[flashback to Phyllis’ birthday, sneaking up on Phyllis’ car] Happy Birthday!
So… I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
We can just have one big fun party. Everybody’s happy, nobody wastes their time.
Wow! You’re shaking things up a bit, huh?
It’s a pretty good idea, don’t you think?
Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.
[leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow]
Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?
Keep going, you’re fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.
You know, try sending them another invoice.
Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
[picks up and reads memo] “Let’s be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let’s celebrate birthday month in style today.” This is really cool.
No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]
Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles]
What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just —
Spin. I’m trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael’s blindfold off] Behold.
Here’s your knife. Here’s your duct tape.
Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug]
Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight. [Dwight runs off]
[knocking from outside window in break room] Jim.
Screw Meredith, I don’t think it’s fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday.
Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake.
Well, I’m gonna to talk to Angela and we’re gonna see what we can do about a pie.
I don’t care who you talk to. Just make it happen.
You tell her it’s for Creed. She’ll know what that means.
There we go. [standing with short sleeves and short pants] Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts [ties jacket around neck].
I’m going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. [puts pant leg on head like a hat]
See, this is a beautiful piece of material [rips other pant leg in half] This could be used for all sorts of things.
Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.
Tuna. [rolls in chair to Jim’s desk]
Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.
Well, I’m just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale.
Alright, I’ll look into it, but the answer’s no.
Wow, OK, harsh. Just don’t expect me to show up.
Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
Loud and clear. [rolls in chair back to desk]
OK, I’m gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael’s office] to do some work. So I will be in here.
Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don’t know what he’s searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.
About two more minutes [cooking bird eggs].
What is Jim thinking? It’s a birthday, so what if there’s a lot of them?
Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there’s going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don’t have some cake soon, I might die.
Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn’t care.
Nothing! Nothing going on. We’re talking about nothing. C’mon gang.
Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I’ve made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy [pats a large tree trunk] may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.
Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is… [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.
Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea.
Well, it… there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot.
I don’t know, I just thought you could include me.
I just though you could add me.  I don’t see the harm in that.
Toby’s great. He’s great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don’t see the harm in that. Well, it’s a cake Toby, so, c’mon.
OK. Yeah, you know what, we’re just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can’t just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
That’s a bummer. OK, then we need to…[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  ‘Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?’
[raises hand] Hey, Michael. I mean Jim.
Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those [points camera to mushrooms] are nature’s best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. [puts them in mouth]
Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael’s mouth]
Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday [Michael joins in with high note] to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. [Creed blows up candles on pie]
Yeah! [everybody clapping] Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want — OK, alright. Yeah, don’t do that. You’re gonna break something.
Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.
Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you’ll figure it out.
Well, I don’t think I’ll be here in ten years.
That’s what I said. That’s what she said.
I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.
Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.
Oh, it’s Creed’s birthday today.  Should we get him an ice-cream cake?  Mint chocolate chip?
We have been friends forever, right?
Yes, I have been working with you forever.
Hypothetically… would you go camping with me, if I were to ask you?  And bear in mind that I would never actually ask you to go camping.  That Jim is also a friend of mine, and I would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.
Here’s the thing.  When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.
Do you understand that Jim is like a brother to me, and I would never do anything inappropriate?
So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?
Split the difference.  Hey… mint chocolate chip, please?  Is Jim out there?
Yeah.  Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in]
Mmhmm.  I had something very personal I would like to discuss. [Dwight closes door, takes off glasses, kneels in front of Michael’s desk]  Would you go find Jim, and send him in here, please?
Michael has employed Dwight to track you down.
And this… is a Hassenfass.  Case-hardened steel.  One side, as sharp as you’d ever want something to be.  The other side serrated for maximum damage.
Look at that.  Perfectly balanced.  This is a fine precision instrument.
All right, Dexter, just give me the knife.
No, just get me a case. [Dwight looks at the camera, lifts his leg onto the desk, removes the sheath from his ankle, and gives it to Michael]  All right.
I’m telling you, all I will need are my instincts and my will to survive.
[holding up knife] What is this called again?
Nobody likes to work late, least of all me. [to Jim] Do you have plans tonight?
Nope I don’t, remember when you told us not to make plans ’cause we’re working.
All right, happy Friday. [to Jim] Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
You said you didn’t have plans. That’s what you said.
Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we’ve been able to get out of it. But I’ve got to give him credit, he got me. Because I’m starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
Michael, what time should I be arriving?
Dwight, it’s couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.
Does it bother me that I wasn’t invited to Michael’s dinner party? [breaks down crying]
Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
Let’s see, since I saw you an hour ago?
I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine]
Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don’t know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
Alright, well, let’s go then, I say upstairs.
Oh, you guys doing a little construction?
Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we’re still a work in progress here.
This is it, check that out, can you smell that? [the room is filled with candles that say “Serenity by Jan”]
As you can smell there’s a lot of different odors going on in here.
So you have an office and a workspace?
I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I’m sure that you’re the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim’s nose] Smell.
James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn. [clicks tongue]
When I get frustrated, or irritated or… angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
[puts away video camera facing the bed] Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
Thanks, that’s my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
Really? ’cause… seems pretty narrow… and short.
It’s actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this. [Lies down]
Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.
No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
Michael, I’m just terrible at all this stuff, so that’s really cool.
Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn’t have audio for a week.
If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.
Well, I saw – oh your Dundies. I’m surprised they’re not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said “Honey keep the trophies.”
Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
[doorbell] Oh, excuse us just a second.
[Andy and Angela enter] So glad you’re finally able to be here.
[Michael tries to hug Angela] No, no.
Tuna! What’s up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? [to Pam] I bet you’re sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! [to Jan] These are for you. [hands flowers]
Except for one flower, which is for… my flower.
How ’bout we do the short tour and then I’ll start dinner?
Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
Oh no no no, it’s just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00?
You know Pam, in Spain they often don’t start eating until midnight.
Do you have a preference, upstairs first?
How ’bout a toast. Shall I? Here’s to good friends.
So music, should we turn some music?
Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
You took me by the hand, Made me a man, That one night, You made everything all right, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah.
You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
Well I think he’s probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
[To camera] I don’t care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for… at a dinner party.
[playing charades] No it’s a… hump. There’s a hump.
Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital.
Why didn’t you just say 49ers quarterback?
All right, [rhythim clapping] my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
What, no, I’m just making people laugh.
Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it’s called ‘Let’s see how uncomfortable we can make our guests’ and they’re both winning. So I’m going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone]
You’ll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
Well you don’t need two of you to do that.
That’s true. Um… dinner sounded delicious. Pam I’ll see you at home, thank you so much.
Oh Jim, I don’t think you’re going to abandon this party here all by itself.
I don’t know because I everything I own is there.
You can buy new stuff but you can’t buy a new party.
That’s true, that’s a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-
No no no, no names, no names,  no rhyming, no soundalikes.
All right, Okay, okay, you’re getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.
No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I’m gonna pass, I’m gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.
[Michael offers his coat to Pam, who is shivering] Oh, thank you.
[eyes Pam] I’m so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. It’s actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
Come on, it’s a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don’t. I shouldn’t say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
You are so right, you’re so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I’m in hell! Aaahhh I’m burning, help me!
I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn’t get. It’s okay, I don’t mind. In fact you know what, girl’s trip, Angela come on. Girl’s trip.
[checking the oven] Uh, not even close.
You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don’t have to tell you Pam.
Oh well don’t tell me that he’s really changed since you guys dated.
Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
I’ve noticed how you look at him at the office.
[in the garage] So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand [the chairs are shaped like hands]. So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan’s candles.
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of “Serenity by Jan” What do you think about that?
I’m sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan’s company?
I’m sorry. [doorbell rings] What now?
Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler]
We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn’t have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.
Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
Whatever I want? It’s never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?
I am so sorry that I don’t want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay?  But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let’s have a [bleep]ing kid.
Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? [Jan walks away]
[crying] I’m just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table]
Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I’ve seen you eat it many times.
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
[leans across to Pam whispering] Pam… I hope she didn’t do anything to the food.
I can’t prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me. [Jan serves the food] Hey, looks great babe.
I know Jan didn’t poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn’t it be me? Michael’s former lover?
[Michael dips his steak into his wine] Can you not do that? It’s disgusting.
You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
Excuse me for a second. [gets up from the table]
[to babysitter] So… how do you guys know each other?
Purely carnal and that’s all you need to know.
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions…
Ok… alright… here we go. [takes down huge painting behind his seat and puts up a neon beer sign] There. [plugs it in] Oooookay.
How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
No. No. I’m gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter’s CD really loud]
[to the guests] Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don’t think he’s that good.
[shouting] AND I’M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON’T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
OH GOOD. I’LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
You know what guys, she’ll be out of the bathroom soon.
[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course
Get out of my way, I’ll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
Not now Dwight, We got a call about a disturbance?
Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
The neighbors said they heard some shouting.
Oh… yes. There was some screaming but… um… my girlfriend… threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
You know you don’t have to press charges, you could just try to be more quiet.
[running out the door)] Michael! [pleading] Michael. What are you doing to him?
Sir, do you have any other place you can stay? Maybe with one of your friends here?
[puts his hand on the Officer’s shoulder] Michael can come home with me.
You people. [to Michael] Come on. You’re sleeping with me.
[Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim’s car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I’ve ever had, babe.
You know, babe, I should have told you but… I did something bad.
[holds up Hunter’s CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.
[Hunter’s voice starts singing, Pam joins in] One night…
Okay, trivia!  Does anyone know what that means?
It’s French.  I studied some French during my semester at sea.  Or, shall I say a semester at la mer, which is French for ‘sea.’
Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office?
The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell.
[Michael comes out of the powder room to rejoin the group] Ahh, did you wash your hands, babe?
Yes, I did, for you, princess.  Even though I only went number one. [quietly to Jim] I didn’t really wash my hands.  Ohhh, what have we here?  This looks delicious. [picks up amuse-bouche tray]
[touching and moving each amuse-bouche] They need to be presented… royally… anyone?
Good stuff.  All right.   Let’s get down to some wine drinking.
Oh, my God, [eating a bar in the hallway] I thought I was gonna pass out.  [Jim takes it from her and takes a bite]
Mmm-mm.  I’m probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost.
[coming up suddenly]  Are you eating?
Really, Pam.  This is a dinner party. [walks away. Pam looks at Jim accusingly]
I’m sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]
Michael’s dinner party is for couples only, which is why I wasn’t initially invited.  But that was then.  I very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.  [looking around] If that idiot ever gets here.
Well, I just got into a little trouble with the neighbors.
Little trouble.  Yes.  Well, Jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.
I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep.
So she’s passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors’ dog…
Yeah.  But, you know, it was my fault.
It’s like, you know, the dog shouldn’t have been outside in the first place.  Anyway, it’s a tragedy, really, because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds…
What are you doing to him?  What… [sees neighbors’ dog] is this about that stupid, ugly mutt?
Please, please.  Don’t hurt him, okay?
Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I’m supposed to park half a mile away.
I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.
[sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
Some of us like the walk more than others.
[to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It’s been awhile.
Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.
But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.
[holding up the catalog] Have you ever seen this woman?
The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She’s got – I don’t know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?
I definitely remember your dinner party.
I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
Actually, I put the catalog in your hands ’cause you have to pick out a new chair.
What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I’m optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. [phone rings]
[on phone] Yo, is this his new chair?
[on phone] No, he hasn’t picked one yet.
When Pam gets Michael’s old chair, I get Pam’s old chair. Then I’ll have two chairs. Only one to go.
I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.
Call us when you get there so we know you’re OK. [Andy gets up and leaves]
[to Kevin] Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?
If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I’d take her for myself.
Whaaaat? God, that’s terrible man. Eghh, she’s crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?
Yeah… ugh. She’s… [gets up and leaves] you don’t deserve her. Alright.
[sitting on Oscar’s desk] Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you’d never touch ’em, because of your condition. Umm…
Sandy. She’s gorgeous and she’s got a feisty personality, too.
Hmm, I see, feisty. So she’s not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?
Umm, no, she’s a professional softball player.
Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?
I think I’m being very clear what I’m asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? [silence] It bothers me that you’re not answering the question.
No, alright no, she can’t fit in a row boat.
Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!
What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they’re just hanging me out to dry.
Dating shouldn’t be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.
[gets up from chair] Write legibly people.
Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.
Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so… Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. [thinks] OK, yes that would be bad.
Wish I could, but I can’t. Well can, but won’t. Should, maybe, but shorn’t.
What part of shorn’t don’t you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.
Oh you can’t because I don’t care. Listen, [Kevin and Andy high five as they leave Michael’s office] don’t forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.
There’s nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.
Well, I’m setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.
Yeah, whatever. [Jim holds up the card] [Pam laughs] Give it to me. Give it to me.
Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try. [Michael dials phone number. Phone rings.]
Hello Wendy, this is Kevin’s friend, Michael.
Oh, I’m sorry, could you put her on please?
[under breath] Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?
You have to come to the restaurant to order food.
Well, I’ll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.
Well put it aside. [hangs up the phone] [Dwight enters] Umm… yeah.
OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm… this one says chair model…
I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn’t have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy’s, get my food. Come back and then go.
[on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
She’s dead? [Dwight makes knife slitting noise] She’s so young.
She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
Why don’t you sit down? Michael… come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah.
Jim, how dare you. [Jim’s face is in shock]
Please, not at a time like this. [sighs]
OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.
Oh really? What’s her name? Burger King?
No, I mean it. [walks towards Michael] She’s really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. [hands over card to Michael]
I don’t, I don’t think I’m ready. Is she hot?
I’m setting Michael up with my land lady. She’s really sweet and… whatever, I just can’t take Michael like this.
No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again.
We need to assemble the five families.
[while brushing teeth with an electric toothbrush] No, not the five families.
[still brushing teeth] Sorry, I don’t have time for this right now. I’m trying to get a date with Pam’s hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now.
[to Andy] I’m calling the meeting anyway.
[turns around to see the woman from his description] Ugh.
Oh, I’m sorry, I’m, I’m supposed to be meeting someone named Michael.
Michael? Michael? [reads cup] Large hot chocolate with caramel and a shot of peppermint.
So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What…
You’re asking what I do with the checks that people write to me?
Why is it so hard to meet people? I… you know… it’s uh… All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?
You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. [holds up cell phone with a picture of Jan] Look at that.
Yeah. Yeah, and you can’t see her whole body. Down here, she’s got a boob job. Just… she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don’t know.
Michael? Hello? Michael? [Michael hangs up phone]
Oh, OK. Well, umm… I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.
Now you ruined it. [gets up and leaves]
Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.
Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.
[nervously stuttering] I… have… things…
Well first of all, I’d just like to say [pulls out note cards] what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen.
W.B. Jones’ construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and—
I don’t have time for this you guys. [to W.B. Jones] Just give ’em back their spaces.
We good? OK. Could have done this over e-mail.
After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see… [starts breaking up] It’s just nice to win one.
Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?
She’s sweet and cute. I thought you’d get along.
Oh, OK, Well I’m looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I’m a man… of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God…[walks away back to his office]
You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh]
Oh I don’t care, I didn’t really like that place that much anyway. I’ll just move.
Oh really? Who’s gonna take you in? You’re messy. You’re a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
Yeah, maybe I’ll just move in with my boyfriend ’cause he’s kind of a slob, too.
No, I umm, well I’m not gonna, I’m, I’m not gonna move in with anyone unless I’m engaged.
No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
Pam, I’m not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that’s not how that works.
And when it happens, it’s going to kick your ass, Beesly. So… stay sharp.
I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.
I don’t know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It’s just… [sighs]
You’re right. What do you mean though?
There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
Wow. [Stanley laughs and high fives Kevin]
[looking at the chair model’s headstone] How did she die?
I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that’s just silly because she’s dead. What do you do?
You wait until next year’s chair catalog comes out and you find someone who’s still alive.
I don’t know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one…
Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?
What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa— oh.
How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
[singing] Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids…drinking whiskey and rye, oh why’d you have to go off and die? Why’d you have to go off [with Dwight] and die?
This’ll be [with Dwight] the day that I died.
Okay, so look that over, make sure it’s accurate.
Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.
You were charging me?  I’m your friend.
You occupied the America room for six weeks.  That’s our most popular room.
There was no other guest the entire time I was here.
Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year.
Dwight, little help with the bags, please.
So, what about you, Angela?  Do you have any single friends?
A cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or…
Love.  Marriage.  Baby carriage.  Those have been my goals ever since I heard that song.  Jan and I had love.  We did not have marriage.  We did have a baby carriage, which I got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a DUI.
Nothing.  Just hangin’.  Chillin’.  No agenda.  Would you consider hookin’ me up with one of your friends?
Oh, all my friends are crazy.  My one friend, Brianna…
That’s hilarious.  What’s her number?
Actually, I know a ton of people that I can set you up with!
Some of my friends’ parents, they’re getting divorced now.  [Michael gets up and starts walking away] So I think some of those, like, older ladies, they’re really looking for a guy to go on a date with.
[‘Rita Klondike 507’ is written on an index card] All right, time’s up!  Pencils down.  Please pass your future Mrs. Michael Scotts forward.
Forcing your employees to set you up is not a, uh, uh, technical violation of any Dunder Mifflin rule.  You know, but neither is forcing them to help you with a shot-by-shot remake of Indiana Jones.  Huh-how do you make a rule book like that?
You don’t have one single girlfriend?
I’m not looking for a perfect 10 here, just somebody to hang out with.  Just fun, healthy young woman.
A kindergarten teacher, who is great with kids, maybe an ex-model, and now she wants to do something with her brain?
How ’bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side?
Yep.  Yeah.  She’s blind, is that a problem?
No, I am, it’s all about the personality, Jim.
Because she’s not a sex model.  She’s a tollbooth operator.
So far, these are my leads.  A blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher.  It’s a start.
This just stinks. Don’t touch it, please don’t touch it.
I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley’s car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
We have peanut butter in the kitchen.
I don’t feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.
Nope. Not for you it’s for your hair, and it is 9 am.
No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.
Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we’re talking about.
Well just don’t leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that’s nice.
Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
Yes, I’m having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
My favorite branch. How’s everybody doing?
Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don’t know that a website’s going to be able to replace that.
I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
Watch your back Jim. I’m just kidding.
I’m here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
I don’t like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I’m not seeing commissions on that.
I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
Did the police solve the problem with the…
Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
I don’t understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
It’s all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You’re chatting with your friends, you’re talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
And then an older gentleman asked you “Boxers or briefs?”
I don’t get the big fuss here, I like the site.
If I’d have created a website with as many problems, I’d kill myself.
Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.
Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. [hugs Ryan]
Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.
But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.
Jim, it’s not the horniness, ok it’s the loneliness that…
Let’s go to New York. We’ll go clubbing with Ryan.
Yes you can, you’re single, I’m single. It’ll be awesome.
Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we’re going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.
Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro’ time. Old ball and chain’s been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I’m saying.
No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let’s go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.
You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn’t have to come in at all tomorrow.
So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas… the one time a year they hear one.
Ryan’s assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.
Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.
I don’t know man, when you think about it, Cabo’s really the third world. I don’t go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.
Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
Nope. I didn’t, but let’s go inside and I can call him right now.
You can’t, I locked the office from the inside when we left.
Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I’m not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you’re both dead.
There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, “What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?” He said, “If I’m dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.”
Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.
Ah, he basically is man. He’s a regular banking wizard.
Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour.
Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
Do you live in a regular sized house?
You really don’t have his phone number?
I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?
When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.
Great, It’s under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or…
It’s ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
It’s not, it’s not Eddie, it’s ah, Evan or…
No guys his name’s not Hank, it’s ah, is it Edgar?
Is it Elliot? Hey ch… chief, this is Jim Halpert from um… where you work. You’re the guy who sits behind the desk… you’re, you’re the, the Afri… African-American guy, I mean you’re. Ah… Who, Who’ve I got here?
Dwight Schrute man. How’s Schrute Farms?
Well it’s weevil season but we were prepared.
Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don’t even know what that means. What does that mean?
They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
Crazy. That’s too much for me man, I’m gonna hit the bathroom.
Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
I’ll order you some cranberry juice.
We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
Sorry guys, but I don’t think I tipped him for last year’s.
By a show of hands, who thinks we’re a better couple than Jim and Pam? [people raise hands]
Back to the Future? [she shakes head] Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course.
Well I’m gonna go back to my group now.
Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
I would love a place where we could meet older
Hell yeah. I’ll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor]
[to bouncer] Check again, Ryan Howard.
[to tall woman in front of him, tapping her shoulder] Excuse me.
[referring to girls in front of him] How did you all find each other?
Uh, we’re the Jersey State Varsity Basketball team. Northeast Regional Champs.
[to Dwight, Michael and Troy] It’s off. It’s not the dude I know. It’s some other loser who won’t let us in without chicks.
Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait. [turns Ryan around annd points to basketball players] You two, Jersey State girls, let’s go.
We’re not going unless we can all go.
OK. You know what, fine. Let’s go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let’s do it. C’mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him [referring to Troy]. Let’s go, c’mon. Here we go.
Hey, look what I found in the back. [shows a football to Pam] Wanna play? Teach you to throw.
Yeah, Pam! Hit me up! Go long. Woo! [Pam throws football, hits Meredith’s face]
Wait, wait a minute, what’s this, I didn’t order this?
It’s for you. From them. [points to Jersey State girls across the bar]
It’s not safe. Anything could have been in there. [to girls] Nice try.
I’ve never met anyone who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool.
That’s one aspect of small pet grooming. What do you do?
Ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.
I’m just gonna just use the powder room.
I know. I don’t wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom.
Hey man, you ever think there’s gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they’ll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare’s gonna rule the world?
Yeah, maybe. [notices previous girl talking to another guy]
[on phone] Please don’t pick up, please don’t pick up, please don’t pick up.
Still haven’t left the house yet, huh?
[on phone] Stop calling me so I can put on my damn socks!
Will do. [hangs up] I’ll stop calling.
Actually, it’s kind of too bad we’re not coming into work tomorrow.
I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. [a few chuckles]
[Michael and Troy dragging Ryan out of the club] Those girls really wailed on you bad.
OK I gotta go. Do not take him to a hospital. [runs away]
Pretty weird. [Dwight and tall girl run out of club]
No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?
Uh huh. [to Ryan and Michael] I’m not gonna call her.
[notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, ’cause I think they can help us.
Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
[to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don’t respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?
This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan’s apartment]
One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have…
Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don’t wannna get my head stepped on.
[to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
No. [Dwight starts singing in German]
Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone.
Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we’re going to take your clothes off.
No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
Guys, I’m going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
Like I said, it’s not about the horniness, it’s about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don’t, I disagree, I say… let’s hear it for the boys.
[drives up to parking lot to notice all the office cars are gone] Son of a bitch.
Ohhh, man!  [sound of Ryan throwing up] There it goes.
[helping Ryan out of the taxi] Come on, come on.
That’ll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi.
It’s dehydration.  He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.
All right, shhh.  Dwight, leave him alone.
Hey, don’t blame me for what Ryan does.  I’m not his dad.  I’m his friend, okay?  And friends are there to help you have a good time.  And sell you the stuff you need to have a good time.
You had a rough night tonight.  But your life is very good, my friend.  You’ve got a great job, you… you can have any woman you want, you’re good looking, you, you know…
Frien..sss…yes, you’re friends with a hobbit, and… look where you live.  I mean, you’ve got it all.
No, I mean this apartment building, it’s fantastic.
Oh, this, this is not my apartment.  This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Well, now I can say that I went to a museum.
[Phyllis, Pam, Toby, and Oscar are sharing iPod headphones] I don’t understand.  Which one is that?
Honestly, the book is so much better than this.
[through the fence to Terri, who’s holding a drink for him to sip] Ah, we don’t know.  They didn’t give him his Christmas bonus this year, so…
[on phone]  Stop calling me so I can put on my damn socks!
Will do. [hangs up]  I’ll stop calling.  [walks into lobby]
No, that was his wife, so he’s on his way.
Jim, how long?  I have to go to the bathroom.
Well, he’ll be here really soon, Kev.
If you hadn’t made us stay, we’d all be home by now.
I’m so cold, I’m gonna faint.  If I faint, it’s totally your fault, Jim.
Let’s be honest, it’s not totally my fault. [indicates Pam]  Shared responsibility.
Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn’t lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it’s warmer.
I’m supposed to turn the lock when I leave, it’s part of my job.
Is that… I didn’t know that was your… okay, so we’re in agreement, this is not ideal… situation.
Do you remember what color my eyes are?
No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.
Wet cement, outside. It’s drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?
Michael you could put your initials in it.
M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don’t…
Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!
Okay… Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let’s hear it!
We-we found some wet cement in the park…
Here it is, you should draw a picture…
Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good…
She’s talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael]
We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea… Maybe the idea of a man.
[with petroleum jelly on his face] Hurry, please.
Greatness is only skin deep, some people say…
Well that’s not true. Other people believe it’s deeper inside…
And… go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can.
[playing with Madlibs] Okay, adjective…
[reads] The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. “Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good… cat food?”
[laughing] It’s a man eating cat food.
Andy and Angela seem very happy… I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
[wearing glasses] Um… yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend’s house and, I forgot my contact solution, so… I had to wear my backup glasses… Shut up.
All right, everybody… Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You’re moving in the wrong direction…
Ub, dub dah, don’t need, I can’t even hear you. It’s just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we’re going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly…
If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.
Well, it’s too late, because I’m proposing… that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more… zing, and a little more pep?
Zing and pep, see that’s those are the kind of words we’re looking for. Yes, Jim?
What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
Now we’re cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme…
An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?… Stanley, earth to Stanley…
Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
We’re havin a little brainstorm session…
…Good, this is good. I’m going to grab a glass of water.
Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning…
What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.
Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate.
We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said “did I stutter,” and I said “wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?” It was joking, Toby, alright?
Well you don’t get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you’re… you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another:
Alright… Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking…
Okay, I will… I’m not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but…
You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter’s stomach hurts when there’s a mean girl at school…
Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it’s probably psychological.
You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there’s an Xterra next to you. They’re always driven by chicks, so there’s your icebreaker.
This car’s crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
Can you go over those options again?
You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It’s gotta be now.
Well I have the, the blue book value…
Seal the deal. Let’s do it. Let’s do this thing. Three, two, one–
Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
I, uh, see that you… gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.
Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn’t mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing’s silly, isn’t it? Friends don’t need to apologize to friends as far as I’m concerned, so we are cool.
It’s like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I’m wrong, and if you don’t like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I’ll say it to my next one too.
Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line–green for money-sales, get it?
There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley…
However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
Ok… Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
Say it. Just do it. Don’t think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two… do it. Give me control. Michael… I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
So… All right, well, you’re gonna have to deal with this yourself.
Hey Pam, I really like your glasses.
All the girlfriends that I’ve ever had have worn glasses.
Yeah, it’s kind of a turn-on for me actually…
Could you just say, “these are due back Thursday”?
No. [Kevin leaves; Pam takes off her glasses; phone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. [puts a notepad close to her face and writes message]
A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody’s business. I’d like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I’d also like to see her topless.
Darryl, [clears throat] have you ever been in a gang?
It’s an advice question, and if you don’t wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It’s, um…
I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?
Yeah them, and the Latin Kings… the Warriors…
Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
Well see, um… in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
That’s when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just… start tickling them.
Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you’re laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you’ve forgotten the whole thing. Ya’ll can just go to church together… get an ice cream cone.
I would’ve never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
[to Toby] I think it’s self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
How do you live with a franchise this bad?
Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
[stammers] I’m sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn’t mean to go over your head.
This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
I’m sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I’m not sure what’s really…
Woah, don’t get all defensive, alright? It’s just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
I’d say all the goofing around at Pam’s desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him… w-with Pam
Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?
Oh we were just… talking about, bureaucratic stuff…
[washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What’s Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
What the hell is this all about? [holds up flier] You’re flipping my car for profit.
I gave you a deal… based on what you said to me.
Yeah, well… seller beware. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.
Yes it is a good idea. It’s the only possible solution I have left.
Because I want you to behave as if I’m actually firing him, Oscar, okay?
Michael, if you hadn’t told us this, then we would’ve thought that you were actually firing him.
I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.
You’re firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I’m gonna let you do this to me?
I’ve watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I’m filing a lawsuit, and I’m gonna tell them about every stupid thing you’ve ever done up in this office.
Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.
That’s it. And uh… do you have anything to say to me?
Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
Do you have any idea how to run an office?
Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
And I think, “there’s no possible way–
But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
Okay, you know what? Why don’t you take my hand, and leave them, and let’s get out of here.
[chuckling] It’s Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he’s mad. So that’s about it!
[starts to cry] I don’t understand why you keep picking on me.
You just, do, and I don’t know why, so… please help me understand.
Well Stanley, maybe you’re feeling that you don’t respect me because you don’t know me very well.
Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I’ve gotten to know you, the less I’ve come to respect you. Any other theories?
All right, you don’t respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can’t talk to me that way in this office, you just can’t. I am your boss. Can’t allow it.
Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles]
That’s the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs]
Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.
You know, I don’t care what he did to me.  He’s mean to other people, that’s what gets me.  He’s just…
Everybody.  He just, he’s always, he’s always talking about people behind their backs to me.
What kind of stuff does Stanley say?
Like that people are stupid, and that they’re idiots, and that they’re sluts.
Because he’s mean.  He’s, he’s like a really mean-spirited guy.  He talks about how gay Oscar is…
And that Angela’s a midget, and that [indicates Jim] your chin is too big.
I know, I know.  I think it’s tiny.  I think it’s too small if anything.  And that your glasses make you look ugly.
She’s never worn these glasses before.
Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude.  Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.
It’s complicated, Pam.  I mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk.
Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.
Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.
I put Stanley on a pedestal, for a long time.  But sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk.  I… jerks don’t deserve to be on pedestals.  Jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are.  Big marble… jerk stand.
Hi everyone.  My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.
Oh, well, I’m already married.  Boys don’t make passes at girls who wear glasses.
Ignore her, those glasses are so cool.
Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.  You should definitely wear them all the time.
Guess who just became the cutest girl in the office.
Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately.
Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]
Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.
I’ve heard that. [reaches down to pick up bagel from the floor]
I’m gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here’s what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs.
Yeah, if I could have seen what he just did, I think I would have gotten angry.
Well, as you know, Dwight has filed a lot of complaints against you over the years.
But now it’s being looked at as more of a productivity issue.
I know, um, but Ryan thinks that, uh, they’re not good enough.
Today I’m heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.
Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I’m dating Barack Obama!
[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?
Maybe he’s going to church. Or court.
Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.
Okay, here’s what we’re going to do:
Mr. Maguire, it’s been a couple of years.
Hey Jim, how are you, nice to see you man.
Phil Maguire, Dartmouth, ’74 [goes to shake Andy’s hand]
Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. [shows blisters on both hands] It’s actually not funny at all. It’s incredibly painful.
Let’s make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?
What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
I’m gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month’s rent.
So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn’t have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn’t have to play basketball. Those were the days!
[Darryl approaches as students throw basketballs] A little over the top, don’t you think?
[holds up single sheet of paper] Um, that’s all we brought.
Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business! [all four of them sit in an empty booth with small Dunder Mifflin sign]  Hello!
[gushing lotion inside his golf gloves] Giddy up, let’s do this.
People assume I’m great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my “knot” on.
I mean, Michael’s gone, can’t we just go?
Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!
There’s some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we… uh, eat a lot of cake!
[laughs] Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.
Hello. Hi. [to Pam] Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.
This is Michael, my boss. [she points] Justin.
Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, “only the best and the brightest.”
He’s totally wrong, Pam. [to Justin] Hey.
Oh, no problem. [looks down] And he signed!  He put his name on the piece of – okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.
Okay. I’ll go look for another one. [she leaves]
And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.
Hey, so how’s the direct mail business going?
I can’t complain, people love their junk mail.
Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
You know what Jim? I’m not really looking to change things up right now, I just came out here to get out of the office for a little bit, so why don’t we just play, okay?
So I guess I’ll just… work on my short game.
[teen approaches table] Hello there.
Well it’s funny that you should ask, because it’s really more than a company…
Yeah, I’m trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being “lured” these days. Thank you Dateline!
Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom]
[over phone] Hiya Pumpkin, it’s Creed.
Say, we’re gonna ditch this bitch. You in?
Are you out? [Angela hangs up] Pumpkin’s out, let’s go gang! [they all make a run for the door, Dwight re-enters room with only Angela left]
My old art room. [finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it’s still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.
Michael, I know you’re swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
Who cares? I’m not there, Jim’s not there, why should they have to be there?
So… what else is up? [Michael hangs up] Mich-
Thank you! [Pam hands him blank paper] What, what is this?
This isn’t Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
Well I think they’ll get the spirit of it.
Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We’re dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.
Oh! [Phil is stuck in the sand trap] Ah, dammit!
You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
Yeah I’ll- I’ll get it out. Thank you.
[silently working] [Pam walks back into office, gets paper out of the copier, shows it “voila” to camera, leaves]
[Jim’s cellphone rings] AH! Come on, Tuna!
Hey, can’t really talk now, what’s up?
I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.
Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
You can try. But I’ve looked at your prices. Even with free shipping? Doesn’t work. It’s just- it’s not in the stars, Jim. [Phil sinks putt] Six.
All right, race to the next hole! [he runs off to the cart]
Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
Shortcut! Shortcut! [drives cart off course, it flips over]  Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!
[hums at copier, Angela waiting behind him]
All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.
Hey! [walks up to Oscar and Darryl tossing basketballs, grabs Oscar’s ball] Game over. [kicks the ball up to the gymnasium ceiling]
Just-in case. What’s your last name?
Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she’s hot!  And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He’s the most… important thing in my life right now.
I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.
This is Darryl Philbin. Isn’t he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will “do” you. [laughs] No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?
Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.
Why, why wouldn’t you say that to her face?
So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn’t bring are even better. Justin, I’m willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.
You didn’t want me before. That’s what you said.
[trying to pick up a beer bottle with blistered hands, struggles trying to take a drink as everyone watches.]
Thank you. [Angela turns to look at him.]
Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
Let’s open a tab, because you and me are gonna be playing more often.
Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
I’ll tell you what. My fiscal year ends in two months, let’s talk then. Sound good?
The job fair will be closing in five minutes. Eighth period will commence as scheduled.
[Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you.
[clink of beer bottles] Beers? You closed it?
Yes! Oh! [runs into his arms, kisses him] Um, congratulations to you, sir. [they shake hands business-like]
Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch]
Oooh!  [Kevin and Andy add suggestive “bow-chicka-wow-wow” vocals]
[standing way too close to Jim and Pam] Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good. [Jim and Pam stop kissing]
I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?
Are you interested in graphic design?
Yeah. Can I fill out an application?
Oh absolutely, here, take a seat. I should let you know right away, this is just an entry-level job. It’s really basic. We’re looking for like, a self starter, someone who can meet deadlines, who just pretty much just go the extra mile, I guess.
Great. And uh, obviously looking for someone who knows Photoshop, and Dreamweaver. Uh, Corel Painter, Illustrator, AfterEffects, all the basics.
Well, kids today have a very short attention span.  They are into texting and video games and sex, and they just, they get distracted easily.  And today they’re being distracted by the other booths.
[clears throat] Hey, there!  Michael Scott, regional manager, Dunder Mifflin.
That is a very firm handshake.  Ow, ow, aahch!  Killing my hand, there.
So, what is your poison?  You like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like…
Sales is and could be very, very cool.  If you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.
[Pam returns] This is one of our staff.  This is Pam Beesly, [takes piece of paper from Pam] receptionist extraordinaire.
You get to look at her.  Why don’t you hold out your hand. [hands Brad paper] Tell me what you feel.
Well, it was nice meeting you, I’m, I’m gonna take off.
Hey, you know what?  Coincidence – I am going to go for a little stroll myself.  Are you psyched about the summer?
Okay, well, I’m gonna go to the bathroom.
[to Brad coming out of the bathroom] Hey.
So, I forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss, so, gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this…
Yeah, I get it, okay, I’m not interested.  Stop following me around; you’re really starting to creep me out.
Nnn, look.  I was just being polite.  I don’t want to waste my life selling paper for your stupid company, okay? [walks away]
I’m gonna take so much money off that guy.  That guy is a whale.  I’m gonna clean him out.  This is really gonna get me out of a hole.
If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino’s.  And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.  And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy.
[tries to break club over knee] Ow! Ow! [tries again] Owooh!
I’m sorry, I’m sort of in the middle of this.
Wait, you want this kid to be in the Air Force?
Absolutely.  Justin is smart, capable, ambitious, and he aims high.
Time out.  You think this kid could be a fighter pilot?
I think Justin can be anything he wants to be.
Have you given any more thought to Dunder Mifflin?
Well, you took away the brochure, so I sort of…
Well, yeah, but you don’t need the brochure.  The brochure is up here [indicates head] and it’s in here. [indicates heart]
I think you are smart, and capable, and you aim high.
That’s what the recruiter just said.
Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second…
Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
[into Jim’s headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
[cell phone rings] K, fine. I’ll just let it go to voicemail.
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Oh, thank you. I’ve been working out.
Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
No! [waves arms] Pam, I’m over here!
Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. [presses buttons on his cell phone] Done.
[office phone rings at Jim’s desk] This is Dwight.
Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
[slams cell phone on desk] Argh! Ahh!!
Today is Toby Flenderson’s last day. I couldn’t sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy… There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.
Mornin’. [to camera] So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I’m going to set my watch alarm… And… [watch beeps]
I can’t believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby’s going away party.
We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
But so far we only have two pictures of him.
Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets…
Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans’ funeral?
If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?
Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-
You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides… although Toby won’t be in them.
I thought that you might say that. [takes off his shoe; hums; takes out cash from shoe]
I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this… ugly weight holding me down, you know?… I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.
So how much antigravity potion do you want?
No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don’t want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
Hi. Yes, uh, I’m Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
As part of my last day I’m training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.
Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.
No way! What did I say? I said that they’d love those sketches. Congratulations!
Oh, thank you! I don’t know why I doubted it, because I’m so clearly awesome!
I don’t know, I didn’t read it carefully, I just saw “congratulations” and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.
So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months…
It’s not a big deal. I’ll come visit you. And you’ll visit me. It’s only two hours away. It’ll be fine. That part’s gonna suck, but it’ll be great.
I wouldn’t go if things weren’t so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn’t go then either. So, the timing’s perfect… And that is the first time I’ve ever used the word “perfect” in here!
[watching from his office] Toby’s replacement. Ugh. Wow.
Well, we know that Toby thinks she’ll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.
Because she… stinks… with her… ways… and her… head.
You know, Dwight, sometimes… I don’t know, I think you say things just to agree with me.
Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?
We need to sell her an elevator pass.
But our, our elevator doesn’t require a pa… [gasps]
Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.
Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
Antigravity… Um… Anti…depressants? I could put you through to someone on that.
I’d like to introduce you to my replacement.
Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here’s how things work here:
T-No. He tortured me… with his awfulness.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I’ll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.
[shaking Holly’s hand] The pleasure’s all mine.
Oh, thanks. I’m really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.
[whispering] Have you been introduced to Kevin?
No. Which one’s Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle]
He’s here on a special work program. He’s slow, you know, in his brain.
Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos]
Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn’t take them.
Well that is a very safe place for them.
Here she is! Holly… You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we’d have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?
Oh… [laughs along] Nice, I’ve never heard that one before actually.
I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?
Oh… What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?
You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?
Do you like it? It’s a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.
I love it. I love it… I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.
No, uh… [shouts] Does anyone have a camera here? [no one answers him] No one has a camera here. Uh…
I’m gonna… I’ll go get one. Stay. [runs out of the office]
[on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it’s big. It is really big.
Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
No, I didn’t. I just logged it in right here, so…
All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
All right, well it already went through, so…
Don’t worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up]
[listening to “Crash Into Me” on his computer] Hmm… Jim? [Jim comes into his office] I am downloading some N3P…
And I’m looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
The two levels being, uh, “Welcome to Scranton”…
Okay. Let’s start with the “I love you” level.
Hey, what’s the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?
Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.
Oh, okay, it doesn’t work like that.
Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.
And that’s really sweet. And you can think that. But you don’t say that out loud, and you definitely don’t say it to her.
I was thinking… fireworks for the party. What do you think?
Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can’t…
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
Because I’m gonna miss Toby. Yep, he’s a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn’t matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]
Well we all want a good party, right?
I’m going to propose tonight. Holy crap!
Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? [looks at the change in his hand] Okay, let’s see… fifty… Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row.
I’m totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
Hello, Holly. [Holly is on the floor with her desk chair in pieces] Woah, what are you doing? You don’t, uh, you don’t have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That’s how we buy them actually.
And the sequel, “Woman Stands at Desk and Works.” So, I have no idea how you, [he sits on the floor] how you sit like that.
[as Yoda] Sit on floor and put together chair we will. [laughs nervously] Yo-da. Um…
[as Yoda] Pass curvy metal piece, you will.
So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I’m not-I’m not… I’m not gonna be in town. I’m going out of town.
Ohh, so you can’t make my orgy? Kidding!
I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know… not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.
Whew, oh God. [inhales] Laying a base. Laying a base…
There you go. There’s plenty of base-laying left, right?… Hey. Hey!
Phyllis, you look like you’re gonna have a heart attack.
Gosh, I just don’t know. Why do you think?
[Michael and Holly are still working on the chair] What’d you guys do?
Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don’t you go home, and come back for the party?
Well, we still have to do the exit interview.
[Michael hands him a present] Wow, thanks, Michael, I…
Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
I’m just having a little exit interview.
Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don’t you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?
No, no, I’ll look at it later. It’s part of my job.
[enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes?
Um… Alright, well then, I will proceed. [takes out note cards] I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um… Who do you think you are?
Yeah. Correct. Um… What gives-what-what gives you the right?
Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?
Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I’ll take a little look-see.
Thank you. [reads] What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?
No no no no no. I’m not asking it. I’m just reading it out loud.
[hides his face from Holly; whispers to Toby] I’ll kill you.
I made it this far, right? What’s the point?
Toby, why don’t you open your present?
Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think… that I don’t even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don’t know which is which…
[unwraps present; present is a rock with a Post-It note rubber-banded to it; reads] “Suck on this.”
That’s… What do you mean, “Michael”? That’s not even my handwriting. [exits conference room] Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- [Michael slams conference room door in his face]
Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is… a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.
…Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?
Thanks, I’m gonna set it to Costa Rica time.
[from outside the conference room] Hey, it’s the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! [Michael, Toby, Holly, and Pam exit the conference room] Hey! It’s the temp! Look! [everyone is crowded around Jim’s computer]
It’s the temp! [all are watching a YouTube video of Ryan being escorted out of Dunder Mifflin corporate offices by policemen]
Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan’s big project was the website… which wasn’t doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice:
[still watching video of Ryan] Oh my God. Ryan… Oh my God.
Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
Absolutely. [dials and hands Jim receiver]
[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it’s Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]
I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn’t- [Holly knocks on Michael’s door]
[voice straining] I’m just worried about my friend.
Just, I’m fine. I’m holding it together. I-I have a business to run.
Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He’s your friend. You know what I usually find?…
Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I’m pretty sure she’s baked on a professional level.
[everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
Sorry, Michael, I don’t think they’re real.
Yeah, who’d have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]
Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn’t he? No, he’s not… Is he?
Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn’t see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.
That’s what she… a lot of places are like that.
I think it’s really cool you hired Kevin.
Okay, here we go. Here we go. [Mose carries a raccoon in a cage] Put it in. [he puts the raccoon in the car]
N-nothing you need to know the details of.
There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!
Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.
Michael, thank you so much for saying that. [puts a hand on his arm] I feel so welcome here.
Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what… wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn’t believe in showing affection, so… sometimes I don’t know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh… I like it! [giggles]
Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay.
Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
Bye. Kevin, I’m really proud of you.
[on microphone] Alright! Let’s hear it for Darryl and his band. [applause] You know what? Let’s also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?
Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? [cheers and applause] But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.
I have done things like um, “Beers in Heaven.”
I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby. [to band] Do you know, um, “Goodbye Stranger”? Supertramp?
[sings] It was early morning yesterday… I was up before the dawn… and I really have enjoyed my stay… Toby must be movin’ on.
I’m gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.
[singing] Goodbye Toby, it’s been nice. Hope you find your paradise…
Don’t tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.
[singing, screaming into the mic] Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby’s goin’ away! See ya! He’s outta here! See ya! He’s outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!
Someday I would love to hear “Beers in Heaven.”
Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It’s uh, it’s uh, very sexual. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Kevin. [answers] Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.
Yeah, Michael, I’m at Gerrity’s. You have to come down here.
Just pay for it and we’ll reimburse you when you get back.
No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there’s something that you need to see.
Yeah. He’s at the supermarket and he needs me.
Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket… it’s a big day for him.
Yeah, that’s true. Don’t move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? [Holly freezes; Michael laughs] No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I’ll-okay, I’ll be back.
Wow, Kevin, really? We’re- [to Jan] Sorry. We’re in the middle of a party. [to Kevin] Is this why you called me down here?
I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
Thanks, Kevin. Um… [Kevin walks away, revealing Jan’s pregnant belly]
Wow. I can’t believe it! Look at you! [Jan laughs] Are you nauseous?
Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?
Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy…
Because you’re pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very…
… we were together. That’s true. And-but, you… are not… uh, you’re not the dad.
You cheated on me… when I specifically asked you not to?
…Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you.  I did not.
So it’s mine, and it’s not somebody else’s, so… I know… the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so…
W-I don’t understand. You always used to be very cautious… I’d wear two condoms.
You’d rather have somebody else’s sperm than my sperm?
If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let’s let Michael have a shot at one of ’em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
Oh, that’s really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
Look, I don’t know what you’re gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um… you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner…
My whole life, I have known two things:
Oh look, they’re starting. [all watch fireworks display; scattered applause and cheers; Darryl’s band plays soft music]
[to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you’re never ever throwing a party again.
[gets engagement ring from his pocket] Hey…
Angela, will you do me the honor… of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? [shows her a ring]
She said yes! [light applause] And the crowd goes wild! Woo! [music starts playing; Jim puts his ring back in his pocket and exhales sharply]
I’ve been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don’t know when you’re gonna meet the right girl and the moment’s gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything… it was right.
Tuna! [hugs Jim; makes small explosion sound] I’m engaged!
I know. That’s awesome, man. That’s great.
Mr. Andrew Bernard… it’s got a nice ring to it.
Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don’t have a picture of the two of us.
[hands Meredith his camera] This one right here.
Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let’s do it again. Pam your smile is weird.
It’s digital, so just take as many as you want.
One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture]
I don’t know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight…
Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants.
I’m not so specific as I can be on my first day, but…
Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar. [they chuckle] Oh…
So… You know, somehow after all those ribs, I’m still really hungry. I don’t know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or…
Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there.
Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. [Kevin is waiting in the car] I gotta buckle him in.
Well this is it. I am here to see you off.
Thanks… [Hank is standing next to Michael] Really, Michael?
I don’t think he’s gonna take anything.
[watch that Michael gave him beeps] Oh, some kind of… alarm.
Party planning’s a real high. Like a runner’s high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out]
What? [turns and sees Phyllis; Phyllis gasps and drops the box in her hands]
Oh, Pam!  Toby says such nice things about you.
Oh, no, he said you were a really good salesman.
I’ve always gotten along well with Toby.  Uh, we’re friends.  But I don’t think we’ll stay in touch necessarily.  I think I’ll probably get updates on him from Pam.
Oh, I think that makes us neighbors.
Oh, maybe you can show me some of the fun hangouts, and where to get my nails done.
I hate that bitch.  I wanna cut her face. [Dwight walks by and hears]
Stop!  Don’t look at me.  On the counter you will find bread, peanut butter, and jelly.  Pretend to make yourself a sandwich.
Scared me.  How’s the party planning going?
I don’t know, I’m not used to the stress.
When I was growing up, my mom said, “the sky’s the limit.”  I could do anything.  Be a teacher’s aide, nurse’s assistant, some kind of volunteer.  But now, I, I’m not so sure.
Yeah, I guess it will be my, uh, thing in Costa Rica, be a nature photographer.
Yeah. Um, you mind if I get a picture?
Think you could…[wants to hand the camera to Jim, but Jim is starting to snuggle up with Pam, posing.  Toby aims the camera, the flash pops up] Okay. [takes picture] Okay.
Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That’s a cool camera.
Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn’t working.  Do you guys know anything about it?
The website is hiding, forming alliances with other sites, preparing an attack for which we will have no defense.
It was down for a couple hours yesterday, then back up, and now I’ve heard from a very reliable source that it is once again out of commission.  And that reliable source is you.
Okay, you could just say you don’t know what’s going on.
Ahh!  I’m sorry, I didn’t, I didn’t see you come in.
Just filling in for Ryan, as a favor.
He had an urgent matter in New York.
Dwight. [to Troy] Michael will be out in a second.
Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That’d be great.
Why wouldn’t you see him?  You work for him.
Troy, do you know anything about this?
Maybe I do.  Enough of your magical riddles!
And if the food stations are here and here… no!  Here and here.  Drinks here, then people can mingle.  But then where would the band go?
It’s times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now.  She’d show me what to do.  That’s stupid; she’s not here.  [looks at watch] She’s at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.
Why don’t we eat more corn dogs?  They’re delicious.
Corn dogs should be the standard.  Corn dogs should be called hot dogs, and hot dogs should be called bad dogs.
Seriously, do you like my idea?  Corn burgers.
I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.
But I don’t think it’s a disaster.  I think it’s fun, and I like the food.
You know what, I didn’t try those. [reaches for one] I could try this.  Augh!  Fried Twinkies, you kidding me?  Starting to wonder about the food in this place [takes a bite].  Oh, God!  That is so good.
When I had my colitis, Toby was very helpful.  He gave me seven weeks off.  When I had my acid reflux, Toby was not as helpful.  So I’m mixed on Toby.
Ach, [to Darryl quietly] okay, okay, play the cutoff music.
…blah, blah, overstaying your welcome!  Let’s keep it moving!  Let’s keep it moving!  Toby, everybody!
I gave Toby my buddy Jorge’s number in Costa.  He’ll hook Toby up with everything: cable TV, women, oh, and this amazing coffee to snort.
This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.
What should we do with all these leftovers?
I’m taking the dumplings for my wife.
No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
[sprays food with bug poison] There. Take those home to your wife.
Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.
I’m excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked.
OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.
Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can’t swallow.
2,336 pounds. Y’all need to learn some portion control.
Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.
Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not — not close to 200…
I’m totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.
All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
Really? ‘Cause I haven’t eaten anything since noon on Friday.
OK. [holds elevator] Stanley, come on.
Oh, I forgot something in my car. I’ll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]
And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose]
No, I didn’t. [Michael laughs] You know why?
Because most of the time, friends don’t talk about other friends’ butts.
But what have you learned about her?
I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she’s allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read “Lonesome Dove” three times.
[follows Jim into bathroom] You have to agree with me. [follows Jim back out] That’s insane.
[forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks]
Hey, if you’re into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
Oh, thanks. I should check that out.
Also — and no pressure — the teacher? He’s a catch.
I’m not a lesbian. I don’t know why I said that… It’s a joke.
There is no joke. I just said it because I haven’t had much luck lately and I’m not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.
Um, I’m gonna head back to my work area and just–
Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212?
Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
It’s not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don’t see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I’ll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
Ang. Ela. [sings] Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay–
Hey, check it out. [hands her brochure] This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper.
Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.
This is where my parents decided not to get divorced.
OK. How do you feel about Maine? [Angela picks up phone and dials] I’m on it. I’ll see you later, love. [Dwight’s pager vibrates, he and Angela walk out]
[exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.
Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.
No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
[sees Pam and Jim through office window, runs out the office] Hey, hey! [falls down stairs, gets up, falls down again] Pam, Pam! Hey!
[frazzled and out of breath] I wrote you a goodbye poem. It’s really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
No. OK. Um, the last word is “seagulls.”
Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam]
All right, call– [leans in to kiss Pam]
OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.
Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let’s move that up. Here we go.
OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.
I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It’s because Holly is kind of a major dork.
[rapping] I’m MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She’s DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!
I don’t really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
Sorry I’m late. I accidentally switched my alarm clock setting to Zapf Chancery. [laughter] Which is my terrible segue into our course, Expressive Typography in New Media.
Some of you may remember from last semester I am Professor Monaghan. [sees Pam leaving] And looks like I’m boring someone already.
[sickly] I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So … gonna look amazing.
I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.
Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing?  Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?
Cool. Thank God they found her, too.
Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who’s your daddy? You don’t know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don’t. [to Jan] Come on. Let’s go in.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
Hey, Oscar. Who’s that woman in Michael’s office with the feet?
So, listen, I don’t know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.
Listen, dummy! It’s not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can’t do it.
No! You do not talk to him like that!
He is mentally challenged. But he’s doing a super job here.
Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?
Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.
[walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast.
I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it’s lights out by 8:30. That’s how I sleep at night!
All right, I am connecting and … you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications–
So what is going on, girl in the computer?
Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I’m gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
OK, can you turn the girl off please? I’m trying to get some work done.
No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello. [picks up computer] Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don’t we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!
Can you put me down I’m getting a little nauseous?
Pam, I’d like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.
Oh, calm down, weirdo. It’s just a joke. She’s such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can’t find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?
Let’s go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.
New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city’s awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?
OK, everybody, let’s suck in our guts.
2,184 pounds, for a grand total — oh! You all gained five pounds back.
Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]
Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
I lost four pounds. I don’t know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.
Angela, you’ll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it’s the generic one. It’s Stanley’s favorite.
Yes, I’ve replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.
I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?
Cake? Who suggested cake? [Angela points to Phyllis]
We lost weight today. I think it’s OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.
What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went — I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years.
Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don’t follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?
Yes, all right. Who else? [to Angela] Can I put you down for 10 pounds?
No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?
This is how we’re gonna do it. Five pounds. I’m asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim’s 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
Wait a second. [removes condom from wallet, throws it to Jim] I don’t want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
I don’t know if there’s any one place that has all these things.
Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.
That is very important to me, so — I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away]
I know I haven’t made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]
Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. ‘Cause– [looks toward camera]
Oh, that’s so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam’s new art? It’s right there. Check it out. [closes door]
[music playing] It’s a pretty lame party.
[watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam’s room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I’m in here waiting it out.
Stanley, Michael’s not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.
That’s so lame they didn’t invite us.
You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.
Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.
It’ll probably be a total disaster, but…
Um, I think you’ll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
You know what? We’re pretty much done here today. Why don’t you just take off early?
Oh, Holly doesn’t need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.
OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?
You know, we’re gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
Happy Birthday, Stanley! [kicks cake onto Michael]
[spreading peanut butter on a bagel] What?
It’s just some of us are taking this really seriously.
I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  It’s going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don’t get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  It’s from Mexico.
[walks in the office] How’s my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception].
Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
Hey Kevin… [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That’s really funny.
I’m keeping a list… of everyone who wrongs me.  So when I’m back on top, they’ll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list.
Well that’s great.  [shakes Ryan’s hand] You’re talking about your court ordered community service?
I don’t need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
[glares into the camera and writes Jim’s name on his list]
Well you lost zero pounds. [everyone grumbles]  No change.  On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
Hey, you know what?  I can’t do this by myself people!  Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out. [flails his arms]
Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon!  Who is slacking?
Ok, let’s just all try and work harder, ok?
This is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do in my entire life.  I haven’t had a very hard life.
Eight point five.  I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt.  But he’s cute, right?
[struggling to speak] Mmm— mmm…  Um…
Close the door.  This is your fault.
I should have been lovers with her first and then friends.  That was terrible advice.  Terrible advice!  You know my seduction method.  I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh—  You sabotaged me.  You sabotaged me, man!
Attention!  Attention!  We only have a few weeks left.  [looking at Phyllis]  And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
How much weight have you lost, Dwight?
This is what I’m gonna do.  I’m gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction.  Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin.  And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.
I wanted to say I’m sorry… for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin’ through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know I’ve changed.
We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight?
Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but I’m dating Darryl, still, and we’re like crazy in love so…
That— I, um… cool.  Well maybe I’ll see you around.
Hello Phyllis.  Do you have a minute?  Listen.  I’m really sorry… about what I said before.  Ok?  I was way out of line.
But you know what, I want to make it up to you.  There is a sure fire sale, but it’s a two man job.  Interested?
[sighs] Sixty – forty.  Hm? [they shake hands]  I’ll drive.
[exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]
And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.
Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch… actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider… coworkers.
Oh, my God.  Ok.  Everybody just act normal.  Don’t say anything.
My ex-girlfriend.  She’s right behind you. Just… hide me.
No no!  Don’t look! [Pam sees an old lady behind him]
Uh, actually, kind of.  Yes.  I just didn’t like eating dinner that early. [they laugh, Pam’s phone rings, she answers]
Hey!  Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit?  I made friends!
[storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!
There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
And you burned over a thousand calories walking home.  And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.  Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! [claps]
Yeah, I took your purse.  What are you worried about?  [Phyllis storms to her desk, picks up phone and dials]  You look great.  I can definitely see the difference.
[into phone] Phyllis Vance for David Wallace.
“…or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate.  Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies.  As was clearly stated in the official starting—“
[in a fat suit, speaking in his Michael Clump voice] Ohhhh!  Bang!  Boom!  Say Clump! Why hello everybody!
It’s my sumo suit.  I just didn’t inflate it all the way.  I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.
Body image.  We are here because there is something wrong with society.
See, you’re always saying there’s something wrong with society, but… maybe there’s something wrong with you.
If it’s me, then society made me that way.  Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, “Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?”
Because you’re kind of doing Michael Clump.
Because it’s your making-fun-of-fat-people character.
How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.
I think of him as more like… a monster?  What about, “I say, I say, I say, I’ll sit on you!”
No, no, no, it goes, it goes… look, “I say, I say, I say, I’ll sit on you!”
Hey!  Why don’t you just sit down, please?
We’re doing this because of you.  So why don’t you just go stand somewhere else.  [to Ryan] Hey.  Hey.  You shaved?
Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.
You’re right, you’re right.  Just, Dwight, do it.  Just say it ok.
[exhales] I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
[stands up] Everything.  She’s perfect.
I wonder what people like about me? … Probably my jugs.
Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?
I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!
I want you to know.  Kelly, look at me!   I want you to know that you are beautiful.  You are truly, truly beautiful.  Give me a hug.  [Michael hugs Kelly, his head in her chest] Mmmmmm.
Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I’m convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven’t seen her in 10 days.  How’s your summer?
Hey Ryan, look.  Shaved off my goatee.  I am goateeless.  We are the goateeless brothers.
Ahaha, Yep! [Dwight looks down depressingly and rubs his new goatee]
Oh, I had a good time, but it’s been three days and no call.  I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so…
Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.
So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so…
You’ve already disappointed him so much.  He can’t be expecting a lot from you.
I… listen, umm, we’re still good for this weekend, right?
No football games, recitals, karate tournaments.
Yeah. C’mon we’ll meet halfway.  You’ll be back for your 4 o’clock class.
I’m gonna write you both up for not working.
I’m gonna write you up for not working.
Ok, well played.  Neither of us’ll write the other up for not working.
The rest stop where that soda exploded on me.  Exit 17, I think.  1 o’clock.
I just got off… Kendall?  I just got off…
No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy.  What, what happened?  Did he call?
And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?
I dunno.  I always call everybody back right away.  He’ll call back though.  Give him until the end of the day, he’ll call.  If he doesn’t, he is loco.
Thanks.  That’s sweet.  Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.
Well, at least everyone lost weight.  That’s all that really matters.
Wait, do we have until the end of the day?
So we’re only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it’s a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.
Leave it to me, boss.  I can get this whole office to make weight. [turns up thermostat] It’s gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.
Andy Bernard does not lose contests.  He wins them… or he quits them because they are unfair.
[Kelly eating in the break room] Hey, is that healthy food?
We’re trying to win a contest here, Kelly.  Please?
Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
Ok, that is fine.  Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?
[sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray]
I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?
Yeah!  I mean it’s a great song.  I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway.  You know?
And you know what?  The guys already know it so it’s easy breezy.
Here Comes Treble, class of ’96 was available for our big day, so, I booked ’em.
And, they are collectively my best man.  And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so… it totally works out.
I don’t know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
[Angela dials the phone] Let’s talk about this later. [Dwight’s pager buzzes]
Mm-wah! [Angela walks away, Dwight follows]
Hey!  This is not half-way!  I did the math.  I had to drive way longer than you.  Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.
I’m calling it.  I guess that’s curtains for the yoga guy.
I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing…
…was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
Aww man, I really wanted to see them.
That’s a shame.  A shame to waste these.  I want to buy them from you.
Michael, you don’t have to buy them.
I do.  No.  I do.  I, I want to.  Trust me.  I really do.
Alright.  Alright!  [tears up tickets]  Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok?  Case closed.  Umm, can I pay you tomorrow?  I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so…
What are you smiling about there smiley pants?  You’re late.
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.
Nonono, no, no, I don’t want to hear moaning.  This is a good day.  You guys accomplished something big.  You lost a ton of weight, literally.  A lot of weight.  And I don’t care what any stupid scale says.  You guys are all gigantic losers.
I don’t know about anyone else.  But it was a good summer for me.  I lost seven pounds.  And you know what?  I’m just gonna take five days off anyway.
[to Holly] I’m doing the blood type diet.
Look what just arrived from the Nashua branch.  [reads from card attached to gift basket] “Here’s something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days.  Nashua branch.” Can I send them a dead deer?
No, you know what we’re gonna do?  We’re gonna take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition.
My dream vacation?  I sleep in, putter around the farm, go fishing for a few hours, take a long run in the forest, check the traps.  Then the sun comes up and I head into work, which is empty, because everyone else is out of town on vacation.
[seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms]  Nice job, Kevin. [Kevin fills jar back up with another candy]
I’m pretty fit.  But in the gay community, there’s a lot of pressure to be ripped.  I got straight abs.  I want gay abs.
Can you turn the heat down now – it’s oppressive.
Yeah, totally.  I’m sorry, Oscar.  Yeah, I didn’t realize it was bothering you.
‘Cause it’s kind of bothering all of us, ’cause it’s really hot, you know, it’s hot, so we can lose weight, so we don’t screw up this whole contest for the entire freaking office, but if you want, I’ll turn it down.
Hello, hello.  Hey!  Your face is almost back to normal.
One more kid calls me “Hellboy,” I swear to God…
These guys took me out on their fishing boat.  I don’t think I caught anything.
[on the computer] No, but I’m going zip lining tomorrow, through the, through the rainforest, with this cool couple I, I met at my hotel.  Wo-woman’s amazing…
Hey, is that Michael?  Does he miss me?  [laughs]  Uh, Oscar?  Are you there?  Hello? [sighs]
I am suspending you without pay for the rest of the year.
Okay, no, I am not.  Dwight! [Dwight runs into Michael’s office]  I want you to take Jim’s chair.  No!  No!  His chair at his desk.  He gets it back on Friday.
I want you to get your ass out of my face.
[sitting on a stack of paper] Yeah, well, if you’re only free till three on Sunday and I can’t get there till one, then it’s gonna be pretty tight.
[from his office] That’s what she said.
[as Dwight tries to take paper out from under him] Hey, can you not?
Can you not?  No sitting devices, Michael’s rules.
No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.
Gah! [tries to dislodge paper with his feet]
Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS?
Okay, I’m gonna need you to make this right or else we can’t be right.
I can’t feel… I can’t feel anything that you’re doing, Michael.
You’re…you know what?  I read in one of those books that you’re not even supposed to give foot massages because it can induce labor.
Oh, just stop making excuses and just dig in there.
I can’t wait to be a father.  I’m going to smother that baby.
Uh, new wicks from Craft Corner, uh, this dress [hands Michael bag] returned to Suburban Casuals, and uh, panty liners.
I really, I don’t want to get panty liners, please…
Well, I, you said you wanted to help, so I…
Will you be able to milk with those implants?
Yeah. [Jan starts to get up] Easy there, old girl. [tries to help her]
Would you just call me when you’re done with the errands, Michael?
[as Jan leaves room] Careful.  Hmm.  She was a keeper.
Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
Ah.  That… they might be off the hook for because I… didn’t tell them.
I just didn’t, you know, want a deal.
OK.  You know what?  Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy.
I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?
A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what’s your game here?
[raises hand] She’s not a virgin, you know.
No, nothing.  Nothing Michael!  Just saying hi. [Michael waves “hi” at the phone]
Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time.
Today is ethics day.  After they finish their quiz I’m going to run my first ethics meeting here.  It’s gonna be insaaaaane.  No, it’s not.  I have to read from the binder.
[trying to assist Michael, who is trying to press play on a CD player] I got it, I got it. [Olivia Newton-John’s “Let’s Get Physical” starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room, dancing]
Let’s get ethical!  Ethical!  I wanna get ethical!  Let’s get into Ethics yeah!  Let me hear that Dunder Mifflin talk!  Your body talk.  Let me hear your body talk.
“Why are you helping her?  You’re not even dating.”  She’s my friend… and… ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship… without her even knowing. Uh…
Ok, let’s give it for Miss… Holly Flaaaax! [everyone claps]
Oh come on!  He’s right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired.  [to Jim] Oh check it out, “Hired Guy.”
[clapping] Ok.  Well done.  Good speech Ryan, you’re a good guy.
Let’s start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning.  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree.  But ideally you would have selected totally agree.
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic. [claps]
Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.
Yes, it’s called time theft, and it’s the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?
[to Holly] Can’t set ’em up like that.
Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I’ll just take up smoking.  I’ll do it.  I don’t care.
I’ll smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
Can we have a moment?  [whispering] Can I talk to you for a sec?  Lot of good stuff. And you look… you look fantastic.
What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
Do some… do some work. [whispering to Holly] People expect a lot from these meetings.  Laughter, sudden twists.  Surprise endings.  You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan.  You need to be Robin Shyamalan.
Well, I just have to get through the binder.
Do you… just… you’re kind of losing them.
Yeah, don’t think about the stakes.  It’ll freak you out.
Ok. [to everyone] Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let’s just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil.  That’s not right.
[coughs to hide his words] Lauren, [coughs] enough with the pencils.
No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  It’s part of the ethics thing.
That isn’t ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
I’ll drop an ethics bomb on you.  Would you steal bread to feed your family? … Boom!
It’s a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it’s not your real family.  You’ve been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
I would not… steal the bread.  And I would not let my family go hungry.
Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.
Anybody?  This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.  Stanley?  Oscar, come on.
To tell you or not.  And I’m glad I did.  I feel very very good.  Cathartic.  I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble.  You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
Yeah, [interrupting gibberish].  Come on, anybody.  Let it fly.
Ok, once in a while I’ll take a long lunch.
Dwight, you’ve really never stolen any company time?
You are a thief of joy.  Anybody else.  Yeah?
Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
Who hasn’t?  Good.  Good!  What else?
No— I, I’d like to hear more about that.
I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out he’s clean, but I’m glad I did it.
Well, let’s keep this party movin’ on.
I’ll go.  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
Meredith, that is serious.  I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there’s also an exchange of goods.
Exchange of steak.  Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?
Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.
I mean all of you have done things I wouldn’t have done myself but Meredith’s actions are really over the line.
So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?
Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don’t know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.
Meredith, why don’t you tell Holly… it’s not what she thinks.  Nothing unethical happened… and that you just like to sleep around.
No… no, this is just a stupid formality.
No, it’s not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?
Nah, I wouldn’t have done it if it wasn’t for the discount paper.  There’s not a lot of fruit in those looms.
Ughh!  For the love of God we’re trying to help you… stupid bag.
What I don’t understand is… why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?
Well it’s funny.  Maybe it’s a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what’s going on here?  I thought I had immunity?
Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I’ve never heard of anyone who’s kept their job after something like this.
[starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds.
Oh you had said that you don’t do anything personal during work time so… I’m just making sure.
Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.
There is no way that that was— [Jim starts the watch]
Well, well.  Holly… lujah!  It’s a miracle, you’re at your desk.
Hoo-ooh!  Reaching!  You’ll get there.  Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there’s no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can’t, you know, just… sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.
Good.  Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
Oh no, no, no.  Your food is no good here, my lady.  [sweeps her food into the trash can, misses]  Sorry!  You know what?  Let’s go out!  Dunder Mifflin’s treat.  Um, actually you’re not a client… so… we’ll just split it?  Ethical.
So, I’ve gone over corporate policy.
What do you think?  What do you think of this place?
Istn’t it?  Yeah, it’s kind of… business/romantic.  So you’re from Des Moines?
Here too.  You know what my favorite season is?
Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.
Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.  Autumn was what I was going to say.  When the leaves change.  It’s just, I… I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don’t think there is any way I can write a report that doesn’t end with her being terminated.
By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it]
I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but… [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?
You know, it’s weird.  It’s practically a shot for shot remake.
Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that’s cool.
Story’s kinda bland.  It’s about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
I just don’t want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money.
Well, that’s very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules.
Ok, new idea.  We don’t report it at all.  We just punish her.
Mmhmm, tell her she can’t have sex for six months.
I don’t think we could enforce that.
I don’t know.  I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
No, it’s more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that… down… where you, where you put, where you put the…
I am just saying that I don’t think that you understand what I am saying.
No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.
I’m saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don’t think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
It’s not a family.  It’s a workplace.
[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
So I guess I can assume that was personal.
[Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine.
So maybe you’re not completely ethical after all.
Yes, maybe I’m not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera]
Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
What’s the only thing worse than one HR rep?
I don’t know.  Can you?  Kendall, my main man.
[on speakerphone] Listen, Holly, Michael, I just got the report that your branch submitted and there’s a lot of stuff about a relationship Meredith is having with..
Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.
Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
Well, I’m not sure these circumstances warrant any action.
Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.
Well, from what I can gather it seems like a gray area.  Look, to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and I don’t know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that.
Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I’m just not happy about the way we are getting it.
I thought it was clear with you, Holly.  Your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training.
Every other branch has managed to get this to us so if it’s not something you can handle then that’s a different discussion.
How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, “I told you so.”  Gently with a rose?  In a funny way, like it’s a hilarious joke?  Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? … Probably the funny way.
Can I have everyone’s attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone’s attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.
Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.
Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.
It’s a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
Get in there right now or I’m gonna lose it! [everyone gets up to go in the conference room]
Now is really not the time, Meredith.
Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.
Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?
I think she got it as a tip, but I don’t know why she didn’t just take cash.
I don’t care what she’s doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
I’ve done some things I’m not proud of.  Committed some atrocities in Vietnam, uh, two years ago.  Princess Cruise Lines.
Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?
Oh, but you mean other than embezzling?
Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody’s car.  I never said a thing.
You knocked the mirror off of my car.
That guy did a lot of things I’m not proud of.
Wait, when you say “that guy”, you mean you?
I mean the guy I used to be.  I’m Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away]
No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you… too?
Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions.
But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?
If I have to answer for everything that guy did… [shakes head] I’m never gonna move on.
We’re never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen]
Hey, anybody see a pair of sunglasses?
Holly.  She’s on the warpath.  She is gunning for all our jobs.  Do you guys have any dirt on her?
Mmm… sometimes her stockings have a run in them.
No.  Something I can blackmail her with.
One time I said good morning to her, and she didn’t say it back.
Stanley, didn’t she say a bunch of racist stuff to you?
You weren’t even in the room!  Thanks for nothing.
Oh, cr…, oh, God.  Meredith, you know what?  I just need a minute, okay?
I’m getting fired, aren’t I?  I can’t get fired.  I got nothing else.  Nothing.  No skill set.  Can’t type, bad on the phone, not great with people.
Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?
Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
OK, just remember to keep breathing.
[drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.
Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.
No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!
I checked the route – there are no potholes.  Come on, get in here and have the baby.
It’s about adapting to the circumstances.
[annoyed] Andy, would you like to have my baby?
Yes! Yeah.  [squatting and pushing] Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!
No. OK, no.  I’m crowning!  I’m crowning!  Aaaaaaaa! [runs into Michael’s office]
All right, OK. [to Andy] Sorry.  Sorry.  Here we go.  Here we go!
Do it! Do it!  Scream!  Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
Babies are one of my many areas of expertise.  Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.
I’m screaming, I’m screaming, I’m screaming! Aaaaaaaa!
[annoyed] All right.  Dwight.  Just push and breathe.
Shhh. No, you can’t have it.  It’s too late.
OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
Aaaaaaaa!  It’s coming!  Here we go! [drops the watermelon onto the floor] Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
Nice touch.  Good.  Let’s try that again.
[eating the watermelon] It is going to be the happiest day of my life. [Dwight gets dressed behind Michael and zips his fly]
Hello ladies, how’s my shower going?  Phyllis, did you get the live storks?
Damnit, Phyllis!  I’m sorry.  [more softly] Damnit, Phyllis.  It was hard enough to convince Jan to come.  So are we set for refreshments?
Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name “Chevy.” And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name “Astird.”
She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So…
It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.  I am going to love it. It’s like when the dog nurses the tiger cub.  Have you seen that video?  It is… it’s so bizarre and unnatural, but… it, it happens.
Hey, I’m collecting for the baby shower.
Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend’s unborn sperm bank baby?
Look at it as if you’re paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.
I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I’m no longer under Angela’s heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
[banging on the glass] Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Don’t talk to them.
Make the party.  Don’t – make the party, please, Phyllis. [Phyllis starts inflating a balloon with a pump] Pump it!
[on phone] So you know Stacy, right?
There’s no one from England, Jim.  Katie studied in Ireland – this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.
So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre’s DeTech half an hour early so they don’t have to sit on the slab.
Anyway, Bogre’s TA Sarah Kaya comes in.
No, Sarah Kaya comes in.  Don’t interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.
So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, “No way.  You can’t reserve seats.” And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy’s new PM pad and throws it at the light box.
[clearly just humoring her] No… way!
No, it’s horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested.
No, Stacy is a boy.  Ugh.  Frustrating.  Why can’t you just be in art class with me?
Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. [hangs up]
OK, I’ll ta…I’ll talk to you later. [hangs up]  That was a good story.
Yo.  I got the Nard-puppy for ya.  What’s going on here?
It’s a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
Awww.  Check it out – who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?
Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert.
Why would that make me a pervert, I –
That’s mean, come on, that’s – [Angela storms out]
[Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan.
Oh no… [Michael enters and notices Jan’s baby]
Jan had the baby and Michael wasn’t there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybody’s.  Except Michael’s.
Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
And the birth instructor thought it wasn’t a good idea for you to be there, so…
Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.
OK, you don’t have any idea what I’ve been through, so, let’s…
I’m sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
[cradling the car seat awkwardly] All right, OK.
[carrying the car seat] Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office:
…trid Levinson.  Hi!  Astrid, this is everybody, look.  This is your family.  You’re going to know them for the rest of your life.
[looking at Creed] Well, he may not be here. Say hello!  OK, here we go. [lifting the car seat high above his head] Lion King!
Michael, Michael, Michael, that’s… yeah… that’s too high.  I’ll take that.
OK, come on, let’s get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.
[sees Jan sizing up Holly] I’m fine, weirdo.  Such an HR weirdo.  Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.
Ready to play some games? Let’s do it!
Michael, the baby’s already been born.
So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
No, the baby doesn’t ruin anything, Kevin, OK?  The baby multiplies the fun.  Let’s just do what you were going to do.
OK…  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
All right, how about some presents?  I want to see some presents. [holding a memo pad] I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.
Thank you.  That’s very sweet of you.
Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
She’s got an Orbit; that’s a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter.  For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator]
Not even. I’m doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan’s shower is going on right now, and she’s singing “Son of a Preacher Man” and everyone’s just staring at her.
I can’t hear anything, there’s like, there’s like machines going-
The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what – she’s been singing for the last twenty minutes!
Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
I’m not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We’re just… a little out of sync.  You know, that’s all.  Oh, great.  I washed my lipstick.
[heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don’t hit the fence.  Oh no, my child!
[throwing the stroller against a high chain link fence] Don’t get stuck on the barbed wire!
[tossing the stroller off a tall heap of tires] Playtime is over!
So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth.
Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing.
Yeah, it’s a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
Um, so you’re in the tub with everything?
Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah.
Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach.
Oh no, it’s actually really hygienic, Creed.
And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth. [everyone starts leaving]
Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No.  No.  This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.
You’re sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I…  but…  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
All right.  Um, I’m just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  I’m exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrid’s 529.  Wake me in twenty.
[voiceover] I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt… shortchanged.
Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
Yeah, I a baby daddy.  Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?  Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
You should stop calling yourself “baby daddy.”
Why, Darryl, because I’m quote white quote unquote?
Because you’re not a daddy, and it’s not your baby.
You feel connected to his baby over there?
You feel connected to this? [hold up his back brace]
You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
[wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed]  No, she’s just on a coffee break.
[with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That’s good.  Now, I need you to – I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready?
OK.  Yeah.  Look at my finger.  Look.  Looook!
What are you doing? What’s going on? Excuse me.
You don’t flash around a newborn baby.  Don’t you know that?
[sees Holly behind Jan] I was just going to…  I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene.  She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
I like to call this… the bumper test. [drags the stroller behind his car and runs into it several times]
Sure you can’t stay a little longer?
Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
All right.  All right, everybody, we’re leaving.  Jan and Astrid are leaving.
You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
Wha – that’s, I hate her.  Wha – God!  Why would you even ask me to – I, I mean, not that it matters, ’cause I don’t, but wha – OK, all right, fine.
Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And I’ll see you… soon.
[just hugs her, and she hugs him back and smiles] You wanna go out?
I didn’t feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly.
[on voicemail] Hey, it’s Jim.  Leave a message.
[on voicemail, because she’s calling Jim at the same time] Hi, this is Pam.  Leave a message.
[walking to his car] Hey, it’s me.  It is 5:03.
I figured I’d catch you walking to your car, but…
Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
I guess this is just one of those days.  It’ll get better.
Hope you didn’t have any major laundry issues.
I finished my laundry.  Got all my socks.  Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?
Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I’m just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
You’re probably upset that I’m even at a Laundromat right now.  But, don’t worry, I’m being safe.  And I’m headed home.  I’m… headed to my dorm.  Not home.
All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother’s belly is?
How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist?
Does that mean there’s no toilet paper in the bathroom?
OK, you know what, I don’t think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and I’m just going to get rid of all of that, so…
Seventeen.  I say seventeen squares.
Yeah, we’re not doing my boobs, Michael.  OK, seven, someone give me the prize.  [to Astrid] Oh, it’s OK…
Did she really just have a baby? She’s so beautiful.
Oh yeah.  Wait ’til you get to know her better though.
Hey! HR lady, stop whispering in the corner please.  Very rude.  You’re ruining the party.
I’m starting to get a feeling for what life was like around here for Toby.
I prefer being stuck in a Costa Rican hospital.
Well, this is a highly exclusive establishment.
Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen?
This is a wonderful shower, everyone.  Thank you.
[to camera] I might have done it with Jan!
It’s not Kevin’s child.  Can’t possibly be.  I mean, I don’t know what I would do.  Sue… icide?
[Jan nurses Astrid with her top down, office workers try to work] Okay, ‘Stridly, you want to try the other side?  Okay, here we go.  That’s good.  Oh, good job.
You know what, Kevin?  Why don’t you just go ahead and stare?  Because, you know, it’s, it’s fine with me.  I mean, this is sooo natural, and so beautiful, and…
New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.
Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.
Paaam-o-laaaaaa… Miss ya kiddo. Miss you… so much.
I’m actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
Oh, that would be great. You need that.
Um, tonight, I’m free tonight. Is that too eager? [laughs]
Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight’s no good. [Holly’s smile quickly fades] Because I am busy taking you out.
[gasps] Oh, I just remembered, I can’t tonight.
Wow… Oh, wait a second, I can’t tonight…
Too many times. It’s all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where… you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don’t know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me I’ll know for sure.
That’s for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. ‘Cause that’s what I wrote on your save-the-date.
J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money.
You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.
I know none of that. If I did, you’d be the last to know.
We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.
Some of what we order depends on whether we’re having sex after. [laughs] Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we’re going to have sex tonight?
Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then… then… then we can do… We’ll just do the restaurant thing first.
Probably get soup or something light.
She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
Angela’s not really a risk taker. And Andy’s not really a risk.
No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we’ve got like an hour and 45 minutes. [sighs] [goofy voice] I’m a crazy eight, I’m crazy.
[walking out of the building] Oh, I forgot my keys.
Oh, after vous. [walking into the girls bathroom]
Thank vous. [chuckling] What? Oh! [kissing]
I didn’t forget my keys, I just didn’t want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?
Not if we turn these dials [getting louder] all the way down. [whispering] Now they can’t hear us at all.
Yes, that’s correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.
Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.
Oscar, I’m now going to be prone to surges.
Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that’s all we have.
That wasn’t us, right? I mean… you remembered to lock the doors?
So much for sex without consequences.
[Jim holds up phone] You are such a dork! Shots!
So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.
You can take the girl out of Philly…
You’re always safe with me. I’m a very good screamer. And one day, we’re going to move to Disney’s Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind.
[cockney accent] Consider yourself… at home!
I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
How’s everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.
I don’t want to talk. I want my laptop back.
Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? [whispering] Creed Bratton.
We’re gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?
We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
Okay, I’m gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn’t get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let’s have an auction. Let’s do this. We’ll auction off people like in the olden days.
So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don’t want. Who would ever come to this?
Michael scored the big ticket item.  Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.
He knows how to get things. He got me.
Listen to me close. ‘Cause I’m only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt]
I think you have me confused with another person.
I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14!
Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.
It squeaks when you bang it, that’s what she said. Let’s hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!
Mike, you can’t do that. It’s conflict of interest.
Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don’t win it. It just says “Creed.”
She thought I was McNabb. [laughing]
Another round, boys? Great. [Jim walks to the bar]
Hi, I’m Kevin. And I’ll do your taxes.
Let’s hear an opening bid, everybody. Who’s first? Kevin do your taxes. He’s the tax man. Kevin the tax man.
Fine. [throws down microphone, knocks down microphone stand]
Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.
[playing blues on a guitar] Me and the blues. It’s me and the blues. [Dwight looks at his watch, then at Angela, who looks away from Dwight towards Andy]
We are getting there folks. Slow and steady. [David Wallace walks in] Well, well, have we been blessed today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Wallace! Whoo!
Thank you Michael, thanks, thanks everybody. I’d like to auction off a weekend at my place in Martha’s Vineyard. Hey, hey!
Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.
Keep it going. Hey batter batter batter.
I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. [the air is let out of one of Phyllis’ tires]
Why couldn’t have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?
Okay, fine. I’ve moved on. Now how do I get her back?
Well Dwight, I don’t think you do. I think you’ve got your answer.
Wait, that’s it? That’s your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
Oh. I get it. You’re trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You’re just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl.
What did Phyllis do wrong? I’ll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. [Dwight has an epiphany]
She’s, um, she’s in New York. She’s at an art school.
Yeah, I’d say she’s happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.
[driving] I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. [sighs]
No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and they’re gone forever. So… oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody.
Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody… really wants a hug, so.
I need a hug, unless you’re gonna give me one.
300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice.
300 and one penny, 300 and one penny.
500 and one penny. One million dollar!
1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice. Sold for 1,000 dollar. [applause] Nicely done.
[driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because… I’m not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around]
[whispering] Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It’s sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of…whether or not I had them- [Holly covers Michaels mouth]
The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it’s all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.
[after accidentally seeing Michael and Holly kiss] No, I did not know that Michael was dating Holly.
Oh, I’m Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.
Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on]
Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?
[Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.
[also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I’ve been up since four!
[dressed as a kitten] Meow. Sweet ‘stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?
[buzzer noise] We were looking for “kitten.”
[phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
Thanks.  My costume’s getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin]
So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can’t even take off my hat, because then I’m Hitler.
[dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I’m gonna make a pencil disapp– oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear.
Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat’s Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets.
Oh, look at all this stuff! It’s only seven hours.
When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.
Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.
Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.
All right everybody. I’m out of here. Jim, you’re in charge.
You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.
All right. We’ll see. [to camera] No.
I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
‘Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.
Thought I’d go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?
Ha ha ha. That’s funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy.
Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you’re not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn’t wear them.
No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I’m applying!
Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?
Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug]
I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!
Mike you’ll drive this every weekend?
We’re gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we’ll just meet in the middle. It’ll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.
Life is a highway, I want to ride it all night long.
If you’re going my way, I wanna drive you all night long! If you’re going my way…
Hey there. So uh, how do you think we’re gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford’s arm looks pretty strong.
Well he’s had a pretty good season so far— Stop saying “we.” You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you’re just doing this to screw with me.
Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn’t have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
I know it’s an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.
Someday, we’ll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
Okay, so here’s what I’m thinking. I’m gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn’t in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.
That’s perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?
Right! That would be hilarious! We should totally dog her, about being an artist, never making any money!
Like she basically has a hobby, for a job.
So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?
Oh, he hates it when we pick on his girlfriends.
They came up with that idea really fast.
This trip was longer than I thought.
Yeah it did look shorter on the map-
Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!  [waking up] Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.
You were sleeping?  You were talking before.
Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
All right. What’s the scoop, how far?
Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.
Pam, I haven’t seen you in so, so long!
All right so now we can sit… and get comfortable.
Yeah. I don’t know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.
Here we go, fourth time’s a charm. “Life’s like a road where you just… one day here, and the next day back…Sometimes you deal with it, today you don’t, sometimes you do, what you want… there’s a world out there…. [Holly sobs] Hey. Are you crying?
No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying]
Oh no no no.. It’s gonna work, it’ll be fine.
Michael we’ve only been dating each other for a few weeks
And I’ve dated four women in the last–
Not last – no. In like the last ten years.
I’ve dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
Michael. Don’t. Don’t. Don’t make it harder than it has to be.
Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I’m gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.
Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling]
You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.
It’s pronounced Ker-nell. It’s the highest rank in the military.
It’s pronounced “Corn-ell!” It’s the highest rank in the Ivy League!
Andy, let’s just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
Yeah, good. Can we— [Dwight pulls out Cornell mascot bobble-head] Grr. Heh heh heh. That’s Big Red Bear! That’s a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!
If you leave on Friday, by five, you’ll be rolling in at… midnight? At best?
And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.
Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we’re talking constantly all the way.
I’ll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.
Maybe I’ll see an accident one weekend?
Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend?
Here’s my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.
My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you’ve met me, and you are happy.
So Pam, how much does an artist make after they leave art school?
Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?
That’s not really true. There’s a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
Maybe Pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin.
Wow, that’s- that’s a little rude. What’s your deal?
Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera]
You know what? I think we’re a great couple. I think we’re a classic couple. I think we’re like Romeo and Juliet. I think we… go together so well.  We’re like peanut butter and jelly, don’t you think?
Then don’t do it. Please don’t do this. Please don’t do this. [they continue arguing]
[leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what’s up, I just thought I’d try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.
No I won’t! I’m not strong! And I’ll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!
[outside men’s room] You might be interested- [stops when he sees Stanley come out]
Andy, I’ve been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go’s?
Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it’s irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.
Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won’t let you in?
Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.
If I had to put Dwight’s chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.
So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You’re doing great.
Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She’s a trumpeter. And, look at her.
That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
Yup. She only knows how to play “When the Saints go Marching In.”
Yeah but, she doesn’t think she’s gonna be like, career musician right?
Here you go again! What is your deal today?
Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides… Louis Armstrong?
The point is Pam, is there are jobs-
And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don’t see me try to get on the Mets.
Pete couldn’t make the Mets. She’s at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
I don’t know if I’m gonna make any money with art.
I mean it’s a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don’t try now, I never will. So…
Guys, what is going on?!  [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]
It was Pam’s idea. Pam was the mastermind.
That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.
Let’s see how well you know your Big Red history.
Mm, I’m sorry that’s incorrect. Cornell’s seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. [writes in a notebook] Comprehension skills, sub-par.
Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook]
What are you writing? Can’t even give Cornell your full attention?
On the contrary, I’m helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
Well, when they get my evaluation we’ll see if they’re interested.
“Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character.”
“Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process.”
“Applicant is wasting everyone’s time with stupid and inane accusations.”
“Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid.”
“Interviewer has turned off applicant’s interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth.” Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.
I have everything I need- [talking over each other]
And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy]
And YOU will not be pleased with the result!
[has won the table war] That is all sir, you may go.
[Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There’s another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.
Well, I’ll be the judge of that. What do you got?
Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it’s very subtle.
Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. “Pam cool. Welcome to the family.”
Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?
Oh that’s mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.
You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I’ll just ride back with you.
But you want me to put it back in the truck.
I’ll be down in just a second. [into house] Holly?
So um… I think I’m gonna go back with Darryl [Holly hugs Michael] Okay. [they kiss goodbye.] Goodbye.
I know it’s hard Mike. Break-ups hurt.
Looked like it. Sometimes when I’m down like this, it helps to sing the blues.
[bluesy] Da na na na na…  da na na na  na…
Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na… want to do that?
That’s when you hit me with what’s getting you down, okay?
No, wait. You’re, you’re supposed to… Never mind. Da  na na na na.
[Whistling, enters office in farmer overalls]  I thought I’d come in casual today. Man, I’m hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?
What, these?  Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state.
I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. [attempts to bite into a raw beet, beet is too hard] You’re supposed to cook these, aren’t you?
[scoffs] Cornell. [easily bites into a beet]
[chuckling] Isn’t it a seven-hour drive?
It’s not that bad. But if I’m really jonesing to see you guys, I can always fly.
[interrupting Oscar] Well, I just want to say goodbye. [hugs Oscar]
[outstretches arms for a hug, Holly reluctantly complies]
[whispers in Holly’s ear, Holly reacts with horrified look]
[pushing Kevin away] Um, yeah, that’s not gonna happen.
Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild.
No, we’re gonna do the long-distance thing.
Oh! You guys are gonna keep dating? That’s so romantic!
I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we’re in the same building.
Oh, well….look, we could always call, or email, or write. I should get all your email addresses.
Yes, we’ll email you, and then you’ll have our addresses.
[talking head] It’s a little sad. Michael and I just started dating. He wants me to stay and get a job around here as a baker. Or a baker’s helper.
[talking head] This is gonna be awesome. This is gonna be awesome. I’ve decided that on my drives to Nashua, I am going to learn French, the language of love. And on my drives back, I am going to learn Spanish; what the cleaning crew speaks.
[talking head] I’m driving them up for five times what I would’ve made at work. I thought I made a good deal. [expression changes from smiling to downcast] Then I realized I’m gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.
[playing cat’s cradle with Holly] Okay, am I grabbing this one?
[chuckling] No, that’s not what you’re grabbing.
[driving truck] Hey, y’all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.
It’s like Driving Miss Daisy, you know?
You gotta include me in the conversation.
Okay, okay. What kind of car games did you play in the ‘hood?
Spot a cow, last person to say “Jackson Five” has to get on its back and ride it.
Were there even cows where you grew up?
Cow surfing. [spots a cow out the window] Okay, here we go, there’s a cow.
Oh, shoot! Okay. All right. All right. [throws up hands] Pull it over. Here we go.
[reaching to open door] I’m gonna do it.
[grabs Michael’s arm] No, Michael. It’s not a real game.
Then why did you say “Jackson Five?”
[both laugh hysterically at portable DVD player on dashboard while Darryl drives, looking miserable]
[makes sudden sharp turn to the left, causing DVD player to fall out open window, then grins to camera]
[rubbing noses with Holly] You’re the one.
You’re better. You’re better than my best.
[plants kisses all over Michael’s face]
[both inhale deeply and lock lips while holding their breath]
[looks to camera for several seconds] At least it’s quiet.
[kiss each other while puffing their cheeks and mumbling]
[in unison while kissing with mouths closed] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!
Hey, you know what would be fun? Like, sleeping.
Here’s what I was thinking. The following weekend, I drive up.
We get right in the car, we pop up to Montreal. It’s like another seven hours.
We could stay in a cozy B&B with a fireplace?
Absolutely. Oh, and you know what, Darryl? You are invited to go as well.
[emerging from convenience store with two ice cream sundaes] Hey, look at that. Fun, right?
Mmm mmm! Remember the 15-scooper we had last week? Wasn’t that good? I was Scooperman, you were Scoopy-Doo. Remember what you said? You were laughing.
No, Michael. I don’t….[mimicking Scooby-Doo] I’m gonna puke!
[laughs] I’ll save you! I’m Superman! Scooperman!
That is a lucky number. Seven. 7-Up. Seven dwarfs.
Hey, y’all wanna hear some loud music or something?
I’m an atheist. Did you know that? I don’t know your religion. There are so many conversations that we haven’t even had yet.
Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That’s crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?
[standing with Holly next to “Welcome to New Hampshire” sign] Oh, it’s really cold here.
[starts to cry] Can we have another? I think I blinked.
[unlocking front door] This is me here.
Oh, you have your own entrance. That’s nice.
He’s just trying to push your buttons.
You don’t think he could get in, though….right? I mean, I don’t care, but I just don’t see how he could. I doubt he could get in.
[reverently] He is fiercely intelligent.
I don’t care either way, so….shut up.
You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can’t do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn’t know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever.
[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that’s not going to make me leave Andy.
No, but it’ll make you respect him less.
Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You’re a man in love!
I was there. That dude is not engaged. I’m not a big believer in therapy, but I’ll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.
Big idea: double wedding. Me, Angela, you, Holly.
No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam.
[enters Michael’s office] Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
Call your mom, Michael. [everyone talking]
[chanting and clapping] Call her! Call her!
I don’t want to do that. [chanting continues] All right. [picks up phone and dials] She is going to freak out!
Why do you always do that? Whenever I’m getting married, you don’t believe me.
I’m not, I’m not getting married. So… [laughs] Psych.
So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I’m out $100.
And I’m out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?
Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and — oh. Oh, it’s the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What’s that doing there? [hands stack of papers to Michael]
I’ll take care of that for you. [crumples receipt and throws it in trash] Thanks.
Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor’s List. “Schindler’s List” parody. … That’s not appropriate, no.
Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn’t know it from looking at her, but Pam’s a gold-digger.
[on Bluetooth speaker] Hey, New York ain’t free. Get back to work.
It’s the world’s tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.
[on Bluetooth] Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.
We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we’re not telling anyone.
Uh, Pam. What do you want on your coffee?
Alrighty, Dwighty, let’s see how you did.
Bring it on. [starts to put foot up on Michael’s desk]
A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
I sell more paper than anyone. [stands and reaches for the file]
Wait, is this a joke? I’m getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
No, but that’s sometimes part of it.
If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?
Impossible to say. I can’t see myself.
Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?
Yeah, pretty psyched. Whoa! That’s my mug.
Oh, sorry. It was just — it was right here.
Right, well, it’s mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one.
OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that’s in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh — Snoopy.
[smiles] It is a great mug. But it’s not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back.
[holds mug next to Andy’s head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don’t see it.
[Dwight slams something on desk] What was that?
Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
It is… more of a spicy brown, actually.
Those can’t be my scores, Jim. For your information —
And I’m going to find that person and punish them.
Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
What do you think I am saying to you?!
I’ve caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.
[on phone] Yeah, I’m looking at it right now. It’s really gorgeous. You guys do great work.
I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani’s first and third weddings. And I got him. [shakes fist] I got him!
[on phone] Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that’s gray too? Fabulous.
Jim, they are a poopy. [Jim coughs, presses button to end call on Bluetooth]
No. [glances at it] Yes, I am sure, Jim. It —
Well, there’s got to be an explanation.
So let’s see what we can find out from reading. [reads] Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.
Maybe it’s because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.
Here’s what’s going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?
Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you’re going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let’s go.
All right, fine. [picks up phone] Brrring.
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
Wow, that’s great, because I need paper.
Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
Would you hold on one second? That’s my other line.
Hello? [laughs] No, I’m just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He’s so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone]
Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we’re having a limited–
Sorry, you’re going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I’m hard of hearing.
He’s hard of — he’s an old man. Let’s go.
OK, as I was saying, right now we are having —
OK, our prices have never been lower.
[shouting] Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.
Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
Well, I should hope so. [Michael takes phone] Who is this?
Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.
Well, this is William M. Buttlicker.
Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?
Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
[covers phone, whispers to Dwight] See how it’s done? [into phone] Thank you very much, sir. I don’t think you’ll regret it. [to Dwight] See what I did?
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
… [whispers] It’s a million-dollar sale.
So it’s called the Shangri-La Tent. It’s two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It’s just really simple, really tasteful.
I don’t want to be married in a tent like a hobo
Nana Mimi can’t be in canvas that long.
Well, Nana Mim — Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it’s in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now.
OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it’s in a field, a hand-plowed field
There has to be a barn that’s old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
Do you have a specific place in mind?
No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight’s car comes screeching into view]
Get in! [he peels off into parking space]
Shh. [turns radio up loud, playing “Centerfold.”] They might be listening to us.
Customer service might be monitoring this conversation.
You never know. Better safe than sorry.
[turns radio down] What are you thinking?
Who stands to benefit from our downfall?
Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there’s little evidence of that.
[on Bluetooth] Ooh, cute shoes online.
I don’t know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
[in New York, humming to herself to the tune of “Centerfold”] Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.
[at computer, spins chair around and makes triumphant gesture] Yes!
I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. It’s Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms.
[on phone] So I’d like to redouble my order, if  you could put me down for, um —
Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who’s there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. [puts down phone and runs away]
[jumps into Kelly’s area] Ha! [Kelly screams in surprise]
You always say that, and I almost never know.
What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?
Of course I am. I know you’re the mastermind, but you’re too stupid to do it by yourself.
Let’s just — Let’s head back to the desk.
You just can’t come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn’t give you such bad customer reviews.
The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn’t! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you’re involved.
[in New York] That’s what she said! That’s what she said! That’s what she said!
[enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but…
Um, we’re cool. [gets up to leave] Bye.
Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn’t go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
I don’t play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?
Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
Her America’s Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That’s crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
I wasn’t. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?
Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.
Well, I can’t be the only one who didn’t — [sees mugs on Angela’s and Meredith’s desks]
[walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]
No. [holds Sheriff’s Department mug protectively]
No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut]
OK, I’m gonna assume that was it. Here’s the thing:
Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?
I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim]
I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis’ head; she ducks] Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let’s get her.
No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let’s talk about this.
Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
Dwight. [to Kelly] I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
What? I — I don’t know what you’re talking about. This is the first I’m hearing about this.
Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.
We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
[looks momentarily flattered, but thinks better of it] Kelly.
You cannot say “I was raped” and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don’t keep doing that. I’ll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.
OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn’t come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn’t even show up, and so you’re bad friends.
We have our confession. I’m calling security. [reaches for phone]
Don’t. Don’t. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She’s got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.
I want to be here when you fire her ass.
I will call you when it is time. [Jim and Dwight leave]
I think you should do that. [Kelly starts fake-crying, then laughing, then she and Michael both laugh]
It’s Pam. Uh, I came to kidnap you. There’s free wine and cheese at the Chuck Close retrospective. Let’s go.
Oh, that’s gonna be great. Who’s Chuck Close?
Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.
Uh, well, actually there’s something else I’d love to talk to you about. Can we go somewhere else to talk about it?
That’s it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
I’m gonna take a big leap and I want to tell you that I think you should not move back to Scranton.
I’m gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
Why did you come to New York in the first place?
Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.
Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world’s tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim’s ear] May I?
Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.
We haven’t decided on anything yet. We’re still reviewing some options, and it’s gonna come down to the numbers.
Well, then. Why don’t you look over some of our materials? [opens album]
While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.
Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal! [shakes Dwight’s hand]
Can’t argue with that. Dwight … [takes Angela’s hand] You are going to make us so happy. [Dwight and Angela grin at each other]
Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted?
And she took a bite, started to choke. So what do I do? I have CPR training. Go around, start doing the Heimlich.
The ring, 10-carat diamond, pops out of her mouth, hits her shrimp cocktail, right onto her finger. Million-to-one shot. All of the Greek people in the restaurant start screaming “Opa!” Which means “congratulations,” so…
[in Jim’s ear] Ask how he’s doing since the breakup.
You know what you should do? Take a vacation.
Maybe go to Sandals, Jamaica. Or the other Sandals, Jamaica. I just don’t want to go by myself.
We should take a look at those surveys.
Why are surveys important? Okay, hypothetical:
Great marks, Phyllis. [Phyllis walks out of Michael’s office smiling]
[hand up, seeking a high five] Up! Don’t leave me hangin’! [they do]
I taught Jim and Dwight everything I know about sales. But there are certain things that cannot be taught, and it is these things that I now must teach them.
Attention, all problem sales persons. Jim Halpert… Dwight Schrute…
Intensive one-on-one retraining will begin after lunch. That is all.
I am no longer the worst salesman in the office. Yes! [Andy gestures excitedly, knocking over his coffee mug] Ow! Dammit!
[laughs heartily and passes a newspaper to Phyllis]
We’re laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight]
[looks at cartoon] How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh?
Haven’t you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.
[laughing louder] And he really nailed them on it. Somebody’s finally holding them accountable!
[looking at cartoon] There’s no way you’re laughing at this.
[peering nervously through conference room window] Oh, I don’t have anything to say. I’m just hiding from Dwight.
[is seen taking apart his phone receiver to check for listening devices]
So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre.
[in Jim’s ear] I wonder what else Dwight’s been right about….
Major pharmaceuticals do not want you to know that beet juice has medicinal value both as an aphrodisiac and a laxative.
The Scranton Zoning Board has a strong bias against beet farmers. The mayor is in the pocket of Big Lettuce.
Battlestar Galactica isn’t a documentary exactly.
The book All The President’s Men is about a conspiracy, just not the one people think.
Jesus had a daughter, and she was the Mona Lisa.
What we have come to know as fake crab meat is in fact real crab meat, and real crab meat is lobster.
I am jetting off on an international business trip.
My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international.  The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery…
Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi.
I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket. [covers Meredith’s face with his jacket] You are now sexy in your culture.
Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back]
[walks up behind Jim and puts his hands on his shoulders] One more week.
Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look]
[on speakerphone] Do you have your passport?
I have my passport. [pats jacket pocket]
I have my per diem. [holds up money] I already know what I am going to spend this on.  I am going to buy a sweater.
Well I’ll just… I’ll use different money for that.
Well, I’m just glad to know you’re happy because you know I felt bad.
And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge.
Wait, why do you need three suitcases?
I do. It’s right here. [indicates to waist]
No, no, no, no, no.  You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. [demonstrates]
Here, let me help you. [reaches for Michael’s money belt]
Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
I’m just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. Translation:
Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid.
Yeah baby! That’s what I’m talking about. That could be you [points at Jim] if you hadn’t forgotten French.  Where is my numbers man?
Look, I know my way around a van.  That is just a van.
[sighs and picks up Michael’s empty suitcases]
[on airplane] Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa.
Handed to me as I sat down.  This was my hot towel.  It is still wet.
Michael Gary Scott rolling like a pimp!
Take a sip of that. [hands Andy his mimosa]
Don’t drink all of it.  Give some to Oscar.
That’s really good. [offers mimosa to Oscar]
You want one of your own? I can hook you up.
I’m sorry.  You’ll need to keep moving.
Yes, this is Beth.  This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
Get back, get back.  Come on, get back to the slums.
Oh boy. [follows Oscar back to coach]
[whisper] Hey… guys, check it out.  My own personal DVD player and 20 movies.
I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich]
Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane? [Andy laughs] My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.
Oh, I’m sorry. There are no meals on flights less than two hours.
[walks into Kelly’s cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I’m going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.
This looks like where I’ll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups]
Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups]
[talking head] No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I’m not gonna flaunt it and I’m not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.
[making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing?  This is so wrong.
[going up escalator in the hotel] This is nice.  This is nice.  Move in here.  Very sweet… ah.
We are going to find out where the action is, my friend.
Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.
Mmm… bingo! [indicates towards concierge desk] Follow moi, bro-sieur.
[to concierge] What about a nice sushi place?  Maybe a place with a view?
Tsk… Oh.  Matsuki.  That’s a good one.  Uh, you may walk there if you wish or you man take the number seventeen bus until 9:00.  Other than that you can take the taxi and the number is right there.
Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um… I–ah! This is great, thank you!
One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?
[nodding towards Michael] The Huntsman.
A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha.  This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure.  And when you meet one, it is intoxicating.  Just what the doctor ordered.
[at school in NYC] Can’t believe this. [pulls out cell phone… sighs]
[over the phone] I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.  I hate computers.
Okay, okay, it’s no big deal.  So you’re not a computer geek.
[looks shocked] W—Wow. Um. Well… okay.
That means another twelve weeks.  [pause] Can you do this for another three months?
It’s not— It’s not about me.  I mean, this your dream.
And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
[over phone] Yeah I’m fine.  Um… my cell phone battery’s low, so I have to let you go.
Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying]
Engaging wings [imitates mechanical sound]
I’m probably going to leave after one drink.
Yeah with a hot slab of Canadian bacon in your hand.
[goes up to concierge from the hotel] Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott.  Good to see you again.
Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez.
Nice to meet you. [shakes Marie’s hand]
Works in accounting.  This is uh, concierge Marie…
…who works at our hotel.  You look, how do you say, radiant tonight.
And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night—
For Madame et monsieur. [hands Michael and Marie a glass of wine]
Everyone is going to end up dying someday.  And I think it’s better to die with people you like… like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie… than to know that there’s somebody out there that you love that you’re not with.
Alright, I’ve scoped out the joint.  Those two dudes are as good as naked.
Come on! It’s Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there. [turns to bartender] Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas s’ill vous plait. [to Oscar] Bad decision in a glass.
I don’t care if you’re gay, straight, engaged… whatever. A guy needs intercourse.
You’ll thank me when they spank thee.
Don’t do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table]
Well, how do you like these apples? [sets drinks on table] Alright, on a scale of 1 – 10, how hot is that dude? [indicates towards Oscar who waves slightly]
No, but he could be yours if you play your cards right.
Dude, you struck out.  They’re totally stuck up.  Here… drink up.
How about this one? It’s Christmas eve—
—and everything’s closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12:00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do?  What do you do? Come on! What do you do?
Uh…A stro cleaners on St. Johns place is the only place open on that day.
Its just that I’ve sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.
What do you see in her?  Wh — what do you see in Angela?
I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle.  She is teaching me to be a better person. And she’s working really hard on that.  And she has the softest skin I’ve ever seen and I can’t wait to have sex with her.
Y–Are you guys waiting to get married, or?
Honestly, I don’t know what we’re waiting for.
Andy, something is wrong with that woman.
I’d like to know.  You should call her and ask her. I’d like to know what’s wrong with her.
I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her?
Do it! It’s a— Call her! [Andy holds up phone]  Oh my God, don’t call her! Don’t call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don’t call her!
Too late, too late. It’s dialing… now it’s ringing. [Oscar laughs] Shh…
That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won’t do me and I think it’s a valid question.
We’ll discuss it later naked.  I want to see you naked.
[standing outside hotel room… whispering] Do you want to get some breakfast or something?
[noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?
Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.
Last I checked, that’s not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.
It’s totally unrealistic.  There are no lines in the parking lot.
You know, it’s true what they say— Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada.
Hey, um… thanks for trying to hook me up.
You kidding me? It’s what I do. Get the whole nine ‘nards. [Oscar laughs]
I can’t believe we called her up. [both laugh]
Totally. [continues laughing] What— Who?
I’m talking about Angela. I can’t believe we called her up last night.
That was real?! I thought I dreamed that.  Oh, God!
Good morning, Michael.  [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting?
Mmmm…. mmm. This can’t happen again.
This has to happen again. Darryl can’t happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press “send”.
I don’t know.  I mean, it’s well-written and all, I just—
Has to be done. We’ll press send together. [phone beeps]
I’d like to see him try. [kisses Kelly… cell phone beeps]
Oh! He says it’s cool. [laughs] He said, “It’s cool”.
Didn’t you two date for like a long time?
Mmm hmm. It’s like a fairy tale! [grabs Ryan and kisses him] Mmmm…
I’ll be honest with you— we’ve been talking with Catalyst Paper. Their prices are better than yours.
Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.  They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.  They are treated like human beings. [sighs]
Oh man, she is so pissed. [sitting down by Oscar]
I get to kiss her forehead. [looks at Oscar] I had a good time hanging out this weekend.
Bro hug? [Oscar shakes head… then sticks his hand out and Andy shakes it] Back to basics. I like it.
I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me.  And he’s delightful! [laughs]
[on phone] Hey! I just heard you guys made the sale.
Yeah, we locked him up for two years.
Good, very good.  See, told you.  Sounds like somebody had a good trip.
The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.
I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.
And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.
I’m sorry to hear the hotel was bad.
Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige.  That was great.  That was great.  That was— that was a—
Michael, please lets listen for a second.
No, David. You listen to me.  Why did you send her away? That— God.  You knew I liked her and you just sent her away.  And that— that was a sucky thing to do man.
That was a really sucky thing to do.
Sometimes, we– [Michael hangs up phone]
You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats.
Good. I need you to make five copies of these. [hands Pam papers]
Alright. First thing in the morning then.
They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.
I— I realized that for whatever reason I… just couldn’t do better than kelly.
Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I’ll stick with my jerkie.
Oh brownies! I’m taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
Yeah why don’t you send that to him in Costa Rica?
Um, I’m just gonna hand it to him right now.
She said she was going to give it to him right now. [starts laughing]
[laughing] She’s probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he’s, see if he’s back.
Hmmm, dare I? [laughs]  You know what? I’m going to, for old time’s sake.  [walks to the annex, standing in Toby’s cubicle] Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex. [turns around and sees Toby]
NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!
[watching Toby at Phyllis’ desk through his office blinds] Look at him.  With his stupid face.  Stupid… tan. No.
Uh, well I’m afraid not.  Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.
Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.
Michael, you texted me, 911 CALL ME.
All in caps.  Do you know what 911 means?
I learned a while back that if I don’t text 911 people will not return my calls.   Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.
Now what I’m curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.
I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
Is there no way we can get rid of him?
I have cause.  It is be-cause I hate him.
[Dwight comes over, starts to massage Michael’s shoulders] Don’t do that.
[pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this?  Disgusting.
So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man’s place?
Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn’t tell you that.
Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk.  I saw some email.  I got peepers of an eagle.
So Jim, you’re gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you’re right.
Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
Whoa, you haven’t told the misses about the castle?  You’re in for a spanking my friend.  Myself and my lady? – no secrets.
Jim, don’t listen to Andy.  I think it’s so romantic.
Oh, it’s on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry.  We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there.
[reading from a note on the microwave] “To whoever made the microwave mess:
Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?
Don’t you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.
Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.
Just because someone likes things clean, doesn’t mean they’re rich.
You want to see some really high caliber acting?  Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. [walks to the annex] Hey Toby, great to have you back, man.  Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.
You’re welcome.  Missed you.  Missed you as part of our family.
Well that’s sweet, I missed you guys too.
So Costa Rica that was – did you have fun?  That must have been fun.
Well, um, it was amazing.  It really was, thanks for asking.  Um the beaches were pristine…
…and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.
Why’d you come back?  Why didn’t you stay?
It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.
[shifting uncomfortably and sweating] Shhh hot, why didn’t you get an air-condition— should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
That’s it, that’s it, perfect.  We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
I love catching people in the act.  That’s why I always whip open doors.
Mm.  Me too.  Okay, let’s get this started.
Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie]
Oh, it’s a good day too. I’m wearing my mustard shirt.
No, for one thing, he’s not gay.  And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim.  Or Ryan.  Or me.
When it comes down to it, it’s a health issue.  I should have written that.
[looks up] Why aren’t you as mad or interested in this as me?
Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn’t come close to touching the reception desk] I’m always this close.
Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.  Hello, Pam.  Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.
Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so…
Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. I’m kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson?  I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.  Do not read it beforehand.  Can you do that for me?
Good. [Pam stands up and starts reading note] N-no no no, don’t.
“Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  I’m too shy to tell you that I love you.”
[kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?
Hey guys that’s really inappropriate.
[kisses for a little longer]  What’s up?
Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?
Toby can I see those? Ooh. [takes photos and throws them on the floor] What’s the matter?  What’s the matter? You scared?
I hope he doesn’t haul off and just hit you.
Do you want to do that?  You want to hit me, you want to punch me?
Come on. [making karate moves] Baaah!
Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who’s side are you on?
Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.  Come on! Come oooon…
I’m not going to punch you, Michael.
Are you really not going to punch him?
[as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.
I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
[mouth full of brownie] Just stop it.  You haven’t done anything helpful all day.
There’s still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
[goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs.
Yeah, it’s illegal, but… everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
I’ve never framed a man before, have you?
Oh I’ve framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
Just seems awfully mean.  But sometimes the ends justify the mean.
Hello.  I’ve seen you guys around.  I’m Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin.   How you doing?  [they stare at him] Uhghh, so I guess you know why I’m here?  I need to purchase something.
No. Uh, I wanted— I wanted to buy some weed? Some…
What makes you think we’d have weed?
I heard you drug—  I heard you dealt.
[whispers in Leo’s ear] Hey, just hold on one second.
[comes back up to Michael] Hey, that’s gonna be 500 dollars.
It’s- it’s two pounds.  I’m losing money on this man just, give me the money.  Alright, walk away.
Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I’m totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
Yeah, it’s crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone’s gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
I guess that’s why we have a temp, huh?
Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.
How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
You’ve seen things cleaned before though, right?
I— Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I… I, uh…
Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  I forgot… I forgot…
We were tipped off about a possible narcotics situation.
Just pretend like we’re talking until the cops leave.
Those are real cops, real guns.  I wonder what’s going on. [follows them]
Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.
Sir, can you step away from your desk please?
Sir, please step away from your desk.
Hey, what’s going on?  You don’t have my permission to do this.
They don’t need your permission, Flenderson, they’ve got the company’s permission.
Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?
Uh, you know what?  I think that this… uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
I have a reasonable right to privacy.
Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
Sir, did you recently return from a trip to Central America?
That was… I went to Costa Rica for a few months.  What is going on?
No, that was… that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate.
That is not mine.  I have never seen that before.
God! No, that’s not… I don’t know what that is.  And I… I bet he has nothing to do with that!
Some basil.  Salad dressing, I think.
Yeah it’s, uh, a caprese salad.  There’s a little bit of, uh, mozerella right there.
Are you kidding me?  That’s my salad.
Gahh, dammit! [punches file cabinet] Come on!
Wait, officers, are you sure you don’t want to interrogate him?
[following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don’t you use them?
You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
I didn’t put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.
Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad… anywhere.
You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.
Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, that’s who you’re worried about?  You’re… you’re worried about the cop’s time?  You think I framed you, and you’re worried about the taxpayer?  Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.
You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.  So…
Yes, you did.  And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of… history.
I think you’re great.  You’re my best friend.
[stops kissing Kelly] I can’t do this.
It’s not fair to you.  And it’s really not fair to me.
Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
That was your choice; don’t put that on me.  I’m just going on a little trip.
It’s not that kind of trip.  I’m going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don’t do it now I’ll never get to go.  And I’ll always resent you for it… you don’t want me to resent you, do you?
Let’s be adults about this.  Let’s have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
[getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent’s house?
I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!
Um, do we have to sleep in your parent’s bedroom?
No, No, we’ll just board that up.  It’ll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
Yeah, I can’t… really can’t move him.
As you can see, we did pretty well, so…
Yes. Yes, I can see… that we did indeed. Why don’t you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.
Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis…
You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year’s budget.
Why don’t you explain this to me like I’m five.
Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer…
So the dollar’s a surplus. This is a surplus.
We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it’ll be deducted from next year’s budget.
We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
Okay, break it down in terms of, um… okay, I-I think I’m getting you…
No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better?
No, no, please. Please do not do this.
Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.
So… we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
[over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I’m good…
Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.
Pam, you make more copies than anyone.
Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let’s just decide and agree upon one.
We should really have the office’s air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.
You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.
I’ve talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they’re with me on this.
Uh, actually, I’m gonna go with copier.
Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don’t have to agree on everything.
Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.
Wow, okay. Well… I swallowed all your ideas, I’m going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.
Dwight, I’m a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms…
I mean, like, “156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left.”
I think Andy makes an excellent point.
But my biggest concern is that there’s only one bathroom.
We’ll dig a trench. As long as it’s downhill from the well, we should be fine.
Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.
Well we’re not gonna put out stumps, come on.
Let’s three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how’s that for a plan?
We’re getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.
So um, I’ve been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing…
I really think you should reconsider.
Oh, Pam, I really… hate that copier.
But I really think you should reconsider.
Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I’m not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you’re on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right.
This is where you’ll have your receiving line. Of course we’ll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
You’re gonna need to be more specific.
Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?
See? That’s how you do it! Makin’ progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] …Darn! Heh.
Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?
I don’t know. I haven’t decided yet.
I’m just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.
So, I guess that’s how they’re gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on.
Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I’ve had two engagement rings, and only one chair?
[laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.
[through the laughter] Oh, is somebody making fun of me?
The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]
Ahh… I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
That’s cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage]
Thank you. [goes to Michael’s office and knocks on the door]
Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?
Um, no, not… no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.
You think that’s good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
Look at that. [begins dancing] Unh. Unh-unh.
Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It’s not that hard.
I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
What is this? All right, we’re all on the same team. Is it- [steps in manure] Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!
[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies]
And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half]
Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that’s okay.
Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay…
Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
[whistling Pachelbel’s “Canon in D;” switches to singing then back to whistling]
[to minister] Hello, I’m Angela Martin, and-
He doesn’t understand a word you’re saying.
And there we go. Okay, and that’s just about it. Man and wife.
Hank, thank God you’re here. The office is at a crossroads.
So, there’s no security problem? You know, I hustled up the stairs.
Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. [Hank takes some jellybeans from Pam’s jar] Yeah, take as many as you want.
Thank you. Thank you. You know, it’s nice and warm up here.
Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-
Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here’s the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.
I was just thinking. Let me see a chair.
Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.
On the one hand, this copier is very old. You should see some of the new copiers they have. You would not believe what they do.
Now the chairs. The chairs are very weak. Very weak chairs. I could not sit all day in this chair.
Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister… it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
I know you did. And that’s why I have taken care of everything.
Well Monkey, he’s a real minister. And you said, “I do.” And I said, “I do.” And Andy wasn’t signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
It does in the state of Pennsylvania.
Take this thing. [takes off twine ring]
My… It’s not my fault you don’t understand German; I’ve been telling you to take it for years!
Are we, uh… are we leaving or what? [Mose hits Andy in the head with a deflated ball] Ow!
Hey David- [begins coughing violently] I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I’m stopping now.
No, no, no, no, no. No. I’m calling- [coughs again] I’m sorry.
Mm. I’m calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?
No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I’m not the bad guy.
Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.
Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.
…Like a tip? [calculates amount] $645?!
I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.
[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday… Okay? Sure, no, I can… I’ll double-check that for you.
I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier… is… [puts paper on glass and makes a copy, then takes paper from glass] working perfectly.
Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
What’s 15% of 200? [Michael doesn’t answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
Hey Michael, what’s 394 times 5,912?
You’re gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
I don’t need $645; I already have $645, more or less.
This is so, so stupid. And, God… [looks at his watch] that’s my phone.
No, I don’t-this doesn’t change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.
Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. [Angela walks over to Andy] What-
[kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
Let me just say, you’ve been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
You are a smart guy. I know you’ll do the right thing.
[groans in frustration] You think it’s easy?
Okay, you know what? Why don’t you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I’m taking the bonus. All right?
It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put ’em in a room, and you just- [Pam and Oscar come to the door of kitchen] Hey.
I just figured I’d rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
Good work. I’m proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother-
Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I’m going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I’m gonna need four. [kisses Pam]
You’re so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?
Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
Yeah, no such thing.  They don’t give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I’m gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
I think it’ll take you a little longer than that.
Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my — [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]
I’m sorry.  It’s the largest one I have.
I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat]
This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is “Nights in Morocco”.  This isn’t your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she’s from Morocco, in which case it’s very accurate.
Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?
Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.
Angela. You’re going to move this for the party right? It’s not on theme.
Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.
I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
Oh, I don’t think it’s blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won’t tell everyone that she’s cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
Ah. You brought in your doll collection.
These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.
Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.
Cool. [sings] My horn can pierce the sky.
This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.
[drinks] Oh… my… GOD!!!  [laughs] Hit me again.
Alright… One more time around the block.
I wish that you’d stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.
[sitting on floor playing the sitar] Hey, hey… Ange… check it out.  [sings] There’s a place in France where the naked ladies dance. [laughs]
Really Andy? It’s Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
[sings] There’s a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.
That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice…ka.
Can’t believe no ones thought of that.
[continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing!
Thank you so much. My daughter is going to love this.
[sighs] Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn’t left India.
[Meredith’s hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!
We got a live one!  On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith]
We’re back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth
Ah… would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
Why don’t we just do it now? We’ll do it quickly.
Well what if we can’t do it quickly.
[mimicking] What if we can’t do it quickly? What if we cant do it–
Do you know how to do an intervention?
Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.
It looks like we’re going to be here for awhile, so why don’t you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.
Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith’s work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.
I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]
I don’t care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic.
Alright, well, let’s look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket]
Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?
I got it on a website, that’s not important.
Michael, We should contact some experts.  You don’t know what your doing.
Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  I’m doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?
Yeah, ’cause this is kind of a drag.
Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.
That’s– you didn’t– you weren’t hurt by that.
Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith.
Okay, no, that’s not what we’re going for.  Who has a problem with Meredith’s drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, don’t you have anything?
Actually, I don’t care for Meredith, but I don’t believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey– come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.
You can say it as loudly as you want, but we’re not going to believe you.
I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don’t think they’re appropriate anymore.
Please stop making me do these things.
You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren’t you wearing the hairnet?
I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on]
I don’t mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.
I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.
Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
Yeah, but you’re gonna need a permit for that.
Oh right, that’ll take a couple of weeks.
Michael, I think… you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It’s Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.
You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  That’s my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so I’m not going to wish that on her. I– a watch would be nice.
[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They’ve been in there for 45 minutes.
I know.  If she wasn’t an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]
That’s a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out]
Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
[whispers to Meredith] I’ll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?
Sure. Wow. [Michael throws a pen at his head] Ow…
Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
Oh, shoot.  Oh well, we’ll have to go someplace else then I guess.
Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let’s get some party music. [changes radio station]  Yeah!
[on phone] Hey Sasha, it’s daddy.  Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?
[shouting excitedly over the phone] Daddy, daddy, daddy!!
No, No, No.  No, I’m just curious if you’ve heard of it.
This is great.  My ex-wife’s going to be so pissed.  [chuckles] For once daddy’s gonna be a hero.
Hey, I’d like to buy one of your dolls.
Oh, no, I– no, no, I was gonna buy that doll.
But I– I promised my daughter. Darryl, look– I– I need the doll, I need the doll.  I– I’m– I’m begging you.  I just– I need it more than anything in this world.  I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.
All right man, don’t cry.  It’s cool.  I’ll let you get it for $400.
[laughs] Oh man, thanks, thank you, [tearing up] thank you, thank you.
Oh thanks.  She’s gonna… [notices the doll is black] oh…
No.  It’s even– it’s even better than the one I wanted.
Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!
Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on–
No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
Yes you are. [tries to pull Meredith from the car]
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
[runs away] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No!
No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
There is no way!  There is no way! No! No!
[dragging Meredith on the floor into the rehab center] Let’s start meeting– Hello. How are you?
This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
I didn’t ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.
Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela’s having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby’s going away party.
Sure. Dooo. Tough room. [chuckles] Come on. I just learned it.  Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It’s actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.
[yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah!
Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
No, no, no, it’s not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
I want another try. Here we go! [Michael runs past the radar as a car passes] Thirty-one! Thirty-one!
I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
Okay, be careful, Kevin. They’re kind of spicy.
So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it’s okay, have a couple more…
[entering the office] Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It’s kind of the elephant in the room, so I’ll just… [sighs] No one has RSVP’ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.
[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.
How about we just… Just have to talk to you for a second…
Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office]
No, no one has RSVP’ed, and I don’t understand it, and now, you’re shutting me out. You’re not even listening. That’s really considerate. Thank you.
[from inside his office] No, what I’m saying is…
Andy still doesn’t know that Angela’s having an affair with Dwight. And it’s been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he’ll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it’s just… awkward.
No. You can’t do that. It shouldn’t come from you.
[to Dwight] Are you still having intercourse with her? [Dwight’s expression implies ‘yes’]
What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
Did you ever have intercourse in this office? [Dwight’s expression implies ‘yes’]
Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight’s expression implies ‘at your desk’; Oscar’s voice breaks] Where, Dwight?
[coolly] Seems like you already know where.
Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would’ve admitted it, and stopped right away.
Because I wouldn’t want an innocent person, who doesn’t know anything about the form… [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?
That was good… It’s just, at the end you weren’t saying something that could also apply to the form.
How about, “I’m sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?”
[on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You’re going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I’m saying is, I want to cut it myself…
[whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me.
I’ve got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
[grabs a spoon from Jim’s coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon.
[moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela’s attention]
That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
Get it over with. Then we don’t have to hide anymore.
You’re expanding on your worst idea.
I’ve already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
When what? [clears throat] When what?
Come on. [Dwight and Jim follow into Michael’s office]
You guys should… be hearing what I’m saying.
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
Angela said she was going to tell him. She’s just not ready.
This shouldn’t be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
Well it’s not too late, because you haven’t done anything.
Michael, once this gets out… I don’t know how it’s going to go down.
[sighs] Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
[to Michael, who opens the door to leave] Have a good trip.
Well… no, I’m not. So I… I’m not very articulate today, so I’ll just leave it for another time. Another day.
[through the car window] Kick Wallace’s ass!
[through the car window] Okay. I will… Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so…
[rolls down car window] Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They’ve been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.
All right. See you later. [backs out of the parking space] Ahh.
I knew something bad was gonna happen today.
[to Dwight] What are you standing for?
If I’m sitting, I can’t disable his neck or his groin.
You’re not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
If I’m sitting, I don’t have the option to.
Dwight, I’m in charge when Michael’s gone, and I need you to sit…
[enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you.
Andy, I’m engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn’t want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake…
Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
I don’t know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and… I don’t know exactly when we started up again.
[quietly] Let me think about it… I, um… there… [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]
So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don’t know exactly how to put this, but… what are you doing right?
Sometimes I’ll start a sentence, and I don’t even know where it’s going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.
This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it’s cooler.
Here’s the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It’s not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It’s Hail Mary time.
[pokes his head in] Hey, what say we order up some pasta?
Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we’re not good together.
Or, we can prove them wrong. Let’s prove them wrong.
No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I’d also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what’s been going on this entire time.
[forcefully] She doesn’t love you. She’s marrying me.
[angrier] Well I don’t know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!
Hey guys, why don’t we, uh, just cool off a bit?
And I’m telling you that I will never back down.
Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
Okay, you know what? That’s enough. Because…
Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon?
That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
I’ve had two men fight over me before. Usually it’s over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.
[thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel.
I will be taking my break at 4:00 in the parking lot.
I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day… leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
[collects Dwight’s weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe]
There’s a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
It’s hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. [gets up] And thanks for coming in.
I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
Okay. [sits back down to continue eating]
[opens his office door] Yeah, finish up.
[shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let’s do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
[watching from the conference room] I can’t believe they’re gonna fight over me.
I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
Mm-mm. It’s 4:10, I don’t think he’s gonna show.
Oh come on, man! Believe in something.
There’s Andy, he’s in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
[still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation…
Andy’s running over Dwight with his car.
Never! [hits Andy’s car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man!
I am a man! I’m a bigger man than you’ll ever be! I would never sleep with another man’s fiance!
You’re not a man! You don’t know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] “La la la la la la la la la la!” What does that mean? You can’t even protect her!
Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When’s the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?
Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain]
No. My right one’s falling asleep a little bit.
Yeah, back off. This isn’t your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain]
What did you say? I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear you.
What? You stupid idiot! [Andy honks his horn] You’re like, you’re like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods…
Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!
I don’t get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?
She said she was only sleeping with me.
[enters, followed by Dwight, and makes a call] Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat… Yep, that’s the one.
[picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can]
Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here’s an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. [sighs] Ahh!
[as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow; Jim catches him and he hands it over]
Well it’s a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
No, it’s going in a different direction then the other wires.
Dwight, I am really busy, I can’t talk about this anymore. [Dwight follows red cord through office past Phyllis’ and Stanley’s desks]
I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he’ll be fine. I made it up there.
What you talking bout, Wallace? [imitating What you talking bout Willis]
So listen, as you know, we haven’t yet filled the regional supervisor job.
There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can’t get a report on it because it’s not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me.
I’ll fax over some of the things we’re looking for.
Fax, why don’t you just send it over on a dinosaur?
[most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank, judging her hotness] Not at all.
Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
Okay, okay, okay. Why don’t we just put this to a vote, and then we’ll be done with it.
[snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand]
[counting votes] Five. Five to five.
[riding in car with Michael] What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.
Alright, I am a local business owner. [Dwight nods along] I need to buy paper.  I find out everything about their prices and policies
I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
You know what? I don’t want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
You will have pancakes and you’ll like it.
No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
Ah ha [popping something in his mouth] Yup.
[spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
Which Means they’re not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.
Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
Good. Here come the sharks. [they imitate jaws theme sounds and Dwight makes shark fin on his forehead]
My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.
I assume your primary paper needs are stationary, general office.
Really? That many? This doesn’t seem like a very big operation.
I opened this place after I came back from Vietnam.
Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic:
What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we’re talking about the same thing here.
Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don’t want to bang a painting.
So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?
You sure know a lot about paper for a lawyer.
Well that is… because… I am a genius.
Hello, I would like to apply for a job.
Hi, I’m afraid we’re not hiring right now.
Why don’t you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son]
Pshaw, that’s nothing. I’ve 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.
I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don’t really see them as real so therefore we don’t judge them as real people.
Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.
He’s making all these fancy, uh, it’s a gut thing.
[Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to “not hot” team] No, it’s is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.
[fingers opened an inch] This close.
My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over]
Hey, hey, how is your interview going?
Don’t blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?
I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great [positioning her towards sign of Prince Family Paper customers] Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left [positions Linda to get better picture]
What’s going on?  Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that’s not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?
Why is this little 2 so small? It’s, it’s weird, you don’t, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?
Excellent! Way to go! Nice! [Michael and granddaughter Prince exchange high fives]
Don’t put that. [granddaughter Prince erases and corrects answer]
Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.
Ok, I wasn’t going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don’t even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she’s hot, she’s hot as heck, she’s a female Boris Becker.
OH! [the “yes she’s hot team” claps]
Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It’s going to be an incredibly hard decision.
Wait; let me get something for you. Here is some, some references. Here is a list of references, our top clients. You call any of them; I trust you will hear some good things.
I… Okay, okay, okay, [in disbelief] alright, thank you. [heads towards Dwight, makes make out lips signal]
[both making make out lips at each other] Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
I cannot wait to contact your clients.
Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. [hurrying out door]
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. [running out door]
All their top clients I can’t believe it.
Someone’s looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. [car hits front divider, screeching]
You drove over that. Go back [car hits divider, screeching]
No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn’t hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]
No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.
You’ve done more then you can possibly know.
Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so…
A tow truck is going to charge you one hundred bucks to take you a mile.  Let me take a look.
He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..
I’ll be right back I’m just going to grab my tool box.
Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don’t even give him full internet access.
See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That’s a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
How much longer is this going to take?
You know let me give you some money for this.
No, I work at a desk all day, its nice working with my hands.
Oh coffee, that’s too much. [Dwight drinks it]
This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?
Well that outta do it. [bumper is heavily duct taped to the car]
Gosh, well so long. [they exchange byes]
I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
Goodbye prince family, [to Michael] should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I’m at it. [Dwight laughs evilly, Michael seems remorseful] Bye bye.
[punches Michael on the arm, beckons to Michael for high five, does not get it, high fives himself, smiles contently]
[entire office is chatting] I’m saying, all I’m saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I’m saying.
No, because… [Dwight and Michael walk in and march into Michael’s office, silencing the conversation]
Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?
Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.
Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We’re doing fine. They’re doing fine.
Why don’t we just, live and let live?
I’m not familiar with that expression,
It doesn’t make sense, of course I’m alive.
Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?  Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don’t do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn’t destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going?
Where are you taking the client list?
Somewhere safe, where it can’t hurt anyone [starts running, Dwight follows]
Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don’t do this. No. [chasing Michael out of the office into parking lot]
Oh shoot! [gets to his car turns around]
Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot]
Those people will be ruined. [runs out back door]
Its business, not personal. [they run back outside, where Dwight gets paper from Michael]
Give it, give it. We can’t do this to those people.
Its over, Michael, its over. [holding list of clients up]
Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? [half of office raises hand] Okay. And all those opposed? [he skips back and joins other half of office in raising hand]
That’s the thing about debating, you’re just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing]
This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.
Look I’ll be in touch, thanks buddy.
Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?
Oh, she is hot. [“Hillary Swank is hot” supporters cheer]
[points to smoke] Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!
Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What’s the procedure?  What do we do, people?
No, we don’t know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
Oh my God! Okay, it happening.  Everybody stay calm.
What’s the procedure, everyone? What’s the procedure?
No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If it’s hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
Oh! Here’s a door.  Check that one out. How’s the handle?
Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once]
Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching!
Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can…
Okay, we’re trapped.  Everyone for himself.
[shouting] Out of my way! Let’s go. Get out of my way!
Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha– Use a what to cover the mouth?
[pulling cat out of filing drawer] It’s okay.  Shh shhh.
A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Let’s remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, that’s the wrong way.  We’ve already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.
I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh– save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!
How about 911?  Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]
Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]
What in the name of God is going on?!
Yes! [Dwight pulls fire alarm] Yes, ba– Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!
Ahhhh!!! [Oscar’s leg crashes through the ceiling]
Go, go, go, go, go!! [Andy and Jim ram the door with the copy machine]
[throws the projector out the window] Help!! Help!!
[blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.
Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It’s not real Stanley. Don’t have a heart attack.
No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! I’m gonna give him mouth to mouth.
No, no, no! Don’t give him mouth to mouth for this!
Open your mouth.  Come on. Don’t swallow it.
[everyone shouting at once] Michael! Michael!
How could you possibly think this is a good idea?
A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
You could have burned down the whole building.
I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.
Did you shout, “Fire!”, causing a panic?
Yes I shouted “fire!”.  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what– heeded–
N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
And, well, I don’t see my co-workers–
Okay. [walks to the window, sighs] This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed.
Yes. We are. We are livid.  But we are going to let this one slide.
Look, this is very serious offense.  We have cause to fire you.
Can you shove down?  Instead… shove down, please.  Instead, what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer.
And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.  Something that Dwight doesn’t like.
Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack.  He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run.  Do you want that on your conscious?
Well… I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What’s the matter? You hungry?
[sighs] No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A man’s life is in my hands.
Don’t you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?
I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
That’s not gonna happen. I’m taking over as safety man.
I’m a smart guy.  I’ll figure it out.
Shhh! Don’t excite him. Don’t make him excitable. [whispering] Welcome back, Stanley.
It’s true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people…
[flashback] Are you from another planet?
[flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? ‘Cause I’ll help you find it.
But the doctor said if I can’t find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I’m going to die.
[in a British accent] A throne for your highness.
No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.
A-B-C. Okay?  And hat stands for… airway, breathing and circulation.
Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means “always be closing.”
This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
[giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can’t keep doing this forever.
You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if you’re by yourself and your heart stops?
Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Let’s do this.
Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but I’m too old to find another job and I don’t have enough saved to retire.  I feel like I’m working in my own casket.
Come on Stanley.  You’re losing you.  You’re losing you. Do it!
Okay, okay.  I’ll show them. Here we go. [whispers] Stanley.  All right.
So, assessing the situation.  Are they breathing?
No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs.
Where are they?  You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don’t do anything.
All right, well, lets get back to it. ‘Cause you’re losing him. Okay, too fast. Everyone, we need to pump at a pace of a 100 beats per minute .
okay, that’s uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour?
Okay. Well, a good trick is to pump to the tune of ‘Staying Alive’ by the Bee Gees.  Do you know that song?
Yes, yes I do.  I love that song. [clears throat, begins to sing] First I was afraid, I was petrified.
No, it’s–Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin’ alive, stayin’ alive.
[to Rose] You were in the parking lot earlier. That’s how I know you.
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin’ alive, stayin’ alive [Andy joins in] Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin’ alive, stayin’ alive.
Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I’m a woman’s man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it’s alright, it’s okay, [Michael and Kelly join in] you can look the other way. Loo do do!
[muttering] Stayin’ alive, stayin’ alive.
Yeah, okay.  You didn’t maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didn’t arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him.
Okay, he’s dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go.
What are you– [people are yelling] What are you doing?
We search for the organs. Where’s the heart? The precious heart.
I’m not feeling well.  I need to sit down.
Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own]
Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
I didn’t think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it’s pretty realistic.
We had to pay for it.  Cost us thirty five hundred dollars.
Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
Okay, look. David, this is why we have training.  We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.
We don’t normally download films illegally.  Because we’re honest,  hardworking people.
But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.
[movie] I want you to meet my nana.  Nana…
Please– Call me Lily. [light chuckle] Let’s play Bridge.  You can be my partner.
[after Pam checks her cell phone] What’s going on?
Uh, no one really knows, but Pam’s parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and… it kinda sucks.  Jim’s been great. But I’m gonna need to buy my dad a robe.
He’s not saying what he needs to say.
I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they’re saying to everyone else, then–
Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They’re catching things that are totally going over my head.
Hi, everyone.  Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?
[clears throat] “I state my regret.”
I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It’s not a big deal.
It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!
Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.
I uh, I’m sorry I didn’t uh, realize you were in a bath.  Do you want me to go?
I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie’s mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.
[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
Yeah… but… eh… breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don’t think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?
So he doesn’t share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter’s fiance?
Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?
Mmm… nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
I dunno. I mean, maybe he’ll talk to you about some of this stuff ’cause he can’t really talk to me about it.
[laughs] I’m ok, I’m not, great, and um… [nods]
What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh…
Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? [beeping starts] What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.
Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?
It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
No no, I’ll help you. I’ll help you up. Here we go.
No, Michael, No. [beeping speeds up]
That’s better. [Michael walks back towards Stanley and the beeping goes up again]
Ok… I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh… Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That’s what HE said! Right guys, ’cause of gay? [Oscar has Stanley’s monitor now] Let’s give this a shot.
Hellloo… [beeping speeds up as Michael gets closer]
Michael, I think you’re what’s stressing everybody out.
So… it wasn’t Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you’re the killer… it’s uh… great twist. Great twist.
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?
After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.
Oh my God. Pam, I don’t know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I’m so sorry, I don’t know. I’ll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so… it was her parents or my parents…
What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
I don’t get it. Do I stress you out?
Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
Speaking of which… [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight’s formal apology]
Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
[giggling] Oh my GOD… Oh man… Ohhhhh my God…
I consider myself a good person. But I’m gonna try to make him cry.
I can already feel people’s stress starting to melt. I think they’re very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.
May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
That was the last signature I needed.
If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here’s a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter]
I normally don’t enjoy making people laugh. [grin]
If you ever called the fire department ’cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be…
Hey Hey, I don’t go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!
I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
You’re so lucky! Good one… [clapping]
Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said “Gross”…
Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.
Pow pow pow… [hands making gunshot impression, sporadic clapping]
[Toby tries to come on stage] NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY. [Toby shrugs and sits back down]
Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
OK. ‘Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
How dare you all attack him like this.
Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
Dwight your’e supposed to do it this way.
Ok, no, they don’t understand who they have…
That is the way you’re supposed to do it, idiot.
You’re interrupting me. I’m trying to get your back.
Don’t you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don’t have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing]
Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He’s supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.
Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?
Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]
Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they’re done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
Mike claims, we’re all a family isn’t that right?
Ok, so um, what’s his name? All the way in the back there.
Roy left years ago. What’s his name?
I don’t believe I have had the pleasure.
Michael I gave you a ride home last week, we spent an hour in traffic…
Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again]
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I’m sorry, Michael’s not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.
[in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles]
Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
[at a park throwing whole pieces of bread] Caw… caw… caw caw… caw…
Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box]
[after snatching the clipboard with her signature] Got it.
[movie] Sam, Sam Sam. It’s not that you dumped my granddaughter, and its not that you want children. It, it’s that you lied to me. Can’t you see that? Can’t you see? Oh, I can never trust you. [Andy looks like he’s going to cry]
Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I’ll see ya then.
So what did he say? Was it my fault?
When you’re a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]
I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm… maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad.
Michael! It’s really good to see you.
Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]
I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.
They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should… better hold onto  them pills, just in case.
You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert.
That’s pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh…
What the heck? Is that, uh… [bends down, cuts phone cords with scissors]
Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.
[knocks on Pam’s hotel door] Hello, good morning.
You ready? And we’re off, like a herd of turtles.
No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you’re gonna find a snowy hill so… Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.
Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.
Yeah, oh don’t say bucks, it’s not lady like. Here we go! [gets in backseat] Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
Hey! Look at what you’re wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician’s assistant?  That’s…
…kind of [retches] Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
[front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly.
Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.
[Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead.
Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
What he said was… [puts finger toward Jim’s face]
[pushes Dwight’s finger away] Just, easy.
…there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
[at the same time as Jim] I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. [shoves Jim’s arm away] That’s on my side.
My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasn’t even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.
But then you fall asleep and there’s nothing for me to do.
Well then… hey you know what then let’s just talk.
That’s okay I can… I’m fine. I’ll just play a song in my head.
You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so…
Is that why your wearing makeup today?
I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn’t hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so…
[laughs] You don’t have to lie. Through here.
For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women.
I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win.
We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don’t forget your birthday, I would never do that.
[while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
In a way, it’s good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
[taking Michael’s picture] Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.
Rolando, [clears throat] I’d like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
[sarcastically chuckles] Uh, your late, everyone’s already in the conference room. Karen will be right here to take you over.
Okay, don’t be nervous, just picture her naked.
[notices Karen’s pregnant] Oh my God. Is that Jim’s?
Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you’re huge! That’s incredible! I… God sorry, sorry my head is… I’m just, I’m trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex, and…
Let’s just get this over with, shall we?
[partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding?
Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven’t blown ’em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
What is that? [looks at sign that says “IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.”] It is your birthday period.
This is more professional. It’s not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man’s.
Have you collected the money from everyone?
[yelling] That’s how much you and I contributed! I… Damn it Jim!
[looking into Julia’s car] Trying to see what CD’s she got. It’s good to know the deets about the girl you’re wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes! [bangs on car and alarm goes off] Whoa! Aah, Aah! [backs up and runs into another car starting another alarm]
Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?
I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.
Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars? [Pam tosses a handful of Mounds bars at everyone]
But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?
But we already know each other’s names.
Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it’s worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
Okay. All right everyone, meeting’s over.
Can I please see you in my office, please?
She is pregnant. She is knocked up. “K” Karen. Pam, let’s go.
I can’t accept these prices, Stanley. They just cut our budget.
Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that’s not how the songs goes.
Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don’t even set me up with her.
We’re not friends. I didn’t think about it.
We are friends. Stanley, we’re friends. And you let me down.
Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.
[thinks for a moment] Give me two clients for her.
I grab this [grabs a chain saw], and I turn it on and I say, “Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre.”
No that’s, that is incredibly dangerous.
You know, I think I’m just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team.
Email’s not scary. This is an opportunity. Don’t, don’t blow it.
Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations.
Thank you. It just all happened so fast.
It’s really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
Yes, Michael. My husband impregnated me.
His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky.
Yeah, he’s so cute. He’s a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?
What is happening there? [points at picture]
Oh, yeah. Don’t even. That’s really dorky.
No, it’s really dorky. You were right the first time.
So, how are things in Scranton? How’s Jim?
Uh, they’re good. Uh, Jim’s good. We’re engaged.
Oh, my God. I’m so happy for you. [hugs pam]
Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It’s a really wonderful moment.
I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You’re in good hands, and give my best to your mother.
So Julia, um, let’s see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend’s house or?
No, it could go straight to our business address.
Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?
Actually, I, I don’t have a boyfriend.
[stammers] Really? Is that… wow, that’s so weird.
Guys, stop everything. I’m about to ask out this girl, and I’m completely panicking.
[quietly] Oh, my desk is over… [quickly walks away]
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I’ve seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up.
All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who’s the boss. Just go right in and kiss her.
I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean.
Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
I’m serious. Um, I’m really glad I came.
Because, um, cause I’ll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and… Now I have closure. She’s happy and, I don’t know, it feels good.
Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there’s all kinds of weirdo’s out here, so…
I am about to die. [laughs] Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?
Okay, Okay. Well listen, you’re a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee.
[points to self] This is the Nard-Dog.
[Andy leans in to kiss her] Whoa. What the hell?
Oh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I’m a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You’re, like, incredibly pretty.
I just got out of a relationship too. It’s really hard.
Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?
Sure, yeah that’s… your right. It’s too soon for… definitely too soon for me. So I’m glad we go that out of the way. I’m gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I’m gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk.
[as Julia is pulling out] Sorry I tried to kiss y…
[struggling to blow up a balloon as his desk phone rings] Damn it! [answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
Mose doesn’t know how to use a phone. So joke’s on you.
Look, I’m at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
Do you think I’m calling you for your best approximation?
[sighs] I’ll call you back. [goes to a filling cabinet takes out a file and looks around]
No.  I’m just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?
Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.
Perfect boobs, [gives a look at the camera] of course I remember Holly.
[scoofs] I’ll just blow off the lecture at Rochester.
[leaning against Creed’s desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly’s party.
[opens wallet and hands Jim a single bill] There you go.
[holding a chainsaw] And I turn it on and I say ‘Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.’
You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She’s the love of my life. She just left… and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.
[Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two?
I didn’t eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn’t eat all my lunch.
[enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
Angela, you’re more chipper than usual.
For a cat? I could get you a kid for that.
I sold Andy’s engagement ring on eBay.
He wouldn’t have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
I have something better than a picture. Come on.
Yeah. [cats meowing] I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I’m out of vacation days. And this company still doesn’t recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
She’s right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
Right. Anyways… I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
[shouts from another room] What did you do?
What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
Why don’t you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
Juvie… nile… Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
Yeah, if she’s old enough to get married, she’s old enough to follow the law. [to Kelly] What did you do?
I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
Well, there’s no flowers… or toys… or— I mean, there’s nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn’t have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
I forgot if there was an “e” between the “l” and the “y.” I still don’t know.
I mean, I don’t even know what the theme is. What’s the theme?!
Those aren’t… themes. There’s always a theme. [walks out]
Okay, you know what, next time, I’ll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
[taking Michael’s picture] Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.
Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.
Yes, we were expecting you. Have a seat.
Thank you. … Um… is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?
Actually, she’s on an HR retreat for the next three days.
But, if you need to get in touch with her immediately, you could talk to A.J. He’s a salesman here.
Yeah, he’s her boyfriend. He’s just over there.
I can’t do the presentation, I can’t- [voice cracks] … just… oh… thinking about seeing him… and… thinking about… him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God! [starts crying, covers his face]
Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn’t want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
I know, just… uh, please, I’m going through something, okay? [exhales]
You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she’ll realize what she’s missing.
And then she’ll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.
Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela’s computer, sounds like crying]
Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela’s computer]
That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
Yeah, I know fixed; that ain’t fixed.
No, now listen. You can’t let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I’ll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
Okay, so all we need is a theme… and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
Hey, what’s that show that she’s always talking about?
Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? ‘Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
You know what? I could use a little help.
We have a lot to do, and you are… putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you’ve been doing, is making a sign?
You’ve been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party’s now at 3!
[laughs] I’m a salesman. That’s why I raised my hand.
Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You’re funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?
Yeah. Why, are you interested? [all laugh]
I have a question about discounts from distributors.
Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you’re dating somebody? Um… is it serious?
Huh- [pauses] Does she ever talk about me? [voice cracking]
What does this have to do with sales?
It’s all connected. Shut up. [to A.J.] Does she ever mention ‘Michael Scott?’
[grunts] Your life. [sits down, upset] Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let’s just- We’ll just continue. [sighs, falls to floor, gets more upset] Oh, wow. [takes deep breath] Ooh, okay.
Yeah, yeah… uh, I can’t do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards.
[whispering] No, no, no, you have to do it-
No, no, I’m okay. I’m all right. [sighs heavily] Okay… okay.
Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows]
[sighs, touches Holly’s sweater, cuts off sleeve, chuckles, sees Word document on Holly’s computer named “Dear Michael,” plugs in USB flash drive to copy file from computer]
[shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time?
I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
[sigh of relief] Well, sorry I’m late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth]
I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I’m pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
[loading up car with Michael] Don’t look up. Don’t look up. [sighs as office workers all looking from window]
I also stole something off of her computer. A document called “Dear Michael.”
I shouldn’t have done it. It just- I couldn’t help it.
No, sh- she didn’t. I’m gonna read it.
No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It’s a violation of her trust.
I know, I know. You’re right, you’re right.
[to camera] What? I’m not in love with her.
[blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too.
I’m not writing, “Horse Hunt.” I don’t even know what that means.
[grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
You’re right, forget horse hunting. It’s stupid.
Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
Here’s one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I’d never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]
Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That’s disgusting, and it doesn’t count. So give me another one.
Schrutes don’t celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?
Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
That’s cool. Hey, you know what’s even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
[to camera] Didn’t see that one coming.
She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
I can’t tell you specifically, but… it’s not over.
What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
You haven’t heard our theme, though.
You don’t hear a theme, you see it… why is there a chicklet on my cake?
That’s the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
[high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what’s it gonna be, Kapoor?
Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
No, watching TV at work is really cool.
Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.
You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We’re gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let’s go.
Move it! Let’s go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
Ahem. This is for you… and [puts blanket around her shoulders] …Happy Birthday, Kel.
[turns off lights] Okay, you’ve got one hour. [shuts door]
[opens door to wake Kelly, bangs together two trash can covers loudly] Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. [slaps Kelly’s butt] Many happy returns. [slams door]
I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.
Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!
Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!
Man, was he fat. So, so… fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.
As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. It’s been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of God’s most perfect creations…a beautiful new cat! It’s tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!
[holds up cell phone showing video of Angela talking to her cats] For a rainy day. [laughs]
Yes, I’m from Techstar about a new phone system for you.   I was wondering if I could talk to Michael Scott.
Really? He’s never around when I come by.
They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But I’d like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. [realizing] Vending machine.
How about I make an appointment to come back?  That way, I know he’ll be here.
[while leafing through Michael’s appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let’s see, he’s really…
[approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don’t need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
[coming out from his office] Hello, may I help you?
That was funny.  Let’s go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!
Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud?
Yeah, I hear ya.   It’s been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy.  So if you think you’re hurting…
This is our first and only Valentine’s Day as fiances.
You’re only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She’s fine.
So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it’s time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
I can’t see them when they’re on the floor
They’re for her to look at, Michael.
Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it’s creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest–
You can’t be a part of our relationship, Michael.
[gesturing Pam to be quiet] –then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine’s Day party.
So suck it.   Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart’s convention, this afternoon. Singles only.
So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
How about now? [Dwight untenses his arm]
I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]
I am about to give blood.  The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that’s a big needle, that —
You’re gonna need to lie down right over here.
Hi, I cant talk right now.  I’m sorry.
Yeah, when I get nervous I sort of clam up.
Whew, it’s better for me just to be quiet, yeah.
Yeah, can I point something out to you?
Sorry, it’s the other thing I do when I get really nervous.
Oh, God. [Michael clears his throat]
Yup, I’m good, whew.  Wow, I feel like a human juicebox. [Blood Girl laughs] Hawaiian blood punch.
Hey, why don’t you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We’ll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.
I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren’t gonna sweep themselves.
Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don’t have blood in them?
Well, ok… bags! [Michael is taken aback] Alright, that was bad.
Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don’t think I ate for three days. [Michael passes out]
[ccming to] Oh my God, how long was I out?  [Michael looks over where Blood Girl was and sees Hank]
Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?
OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that’s hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if I’m gonna return her glove.
I’m sorry sir we can’t give out that information. [Michael sighs]
[seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing?
I’ll help. [Meredith tears the wings off of a Cupid]  Now it’s just a stupid baby.
It is so nice to go out with another couple.
I honestly don’t know how you can work with that jackass, that other jackass, and that new jackass.
He’s talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy.
Well, his heart was in the right place.
Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex. [Kelly looks hurt]  Okay, sorry, let’s, who else?  Oscar.
Come on, I’m sure there’s something you need to get off your chest.
If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  I’m sure whatever you did it wasn’t your fault.  OK well, who else?
Everyone here who’s bowled a 280 please raise your hand. [Bob does so]
Okay. Now everyone here who’s bowled under 70 raise their hand.
Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]
One time. You love bringing up that one time, don’t you?
Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.
But! That girl must’ve had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
No, you just have little dainty fingers.
Oh yeah.  You can always model ladies’ jewelry.
Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but…
Moron, if he was there wouldn’t be a story.
He told me he wasn’t gay. [everyone groans]
A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says “I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.” [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]
Well then it’s a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!
My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
Yeah, Dwight and Andy.  We were here.
No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he’s just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he’s hot air ballooning and later he’s got a couple’s massage.
My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said “Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!” and she said that we’re done.
You know what guys? I don’t think we need to do this.
You’re right.  OK everyone,  back to work.
Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you’re not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You’re like the guy who invented the seat belt.
I’m ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
No.  No, I meant about being single today.
Hello. [two women, a blonde and a redhead, enter the office.  Michael and Dwight walk towards them and Dwight extends his hand to the redhead]
Dwight K. Schrute. Why don’t you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight.
Babe alert! [to the redhead]  Hello, I’m Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.
Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
[after a short pause] So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.  [after another pause] Where you from?
Yeah, OK.  Well, he only gets better.
I can untie any knot.  I’m serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead.
You shouldn’t believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
Um, I work at a place that does catalogs for community colleges and small businesses.
What’s the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
I think if you ordered hot food you’re allowed to eat.
Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They’ve been in there for like ten minutes.
Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food.
Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries.
We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]
At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It’s really cool.
I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity].   No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused].  She left me.   [Kevin walks away dejected]
I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So… fast.
So, Eric.  You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.
Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that’s sort of a repair.  Alright, I’ll let you guys talk.
…and the kind of discounts we’re talking about are not… hold on – Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
Nobody’s after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.
You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
It’s not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.
Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it’s like a fairy tale.
Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don’t add up.
Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.
[looking up from her pilfering of Bob’s food] What?
No, just kidding.  Seriously though, that’s enough.
Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.
Well they didn’t dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
I thought we were having a nice time.
[emerging from the Men’s room] Empty.
[exiting the Ladies’ room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it.  Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate]
Is this the party? [everyone turns to Michael wanting to know if this is Blood Girl]
Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.
Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.
Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob’s meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]
Hey, I’m sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
Oh-oh-oh before you go, I’d just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign–
Look, we already have a paper supplier.
OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!
Really? [everybody signifies their agreement, and Kelly gives Michael a piece of cake]  Oh, thanks.
You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I’m gonna soldier on a little bit.
Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I’m still feeling woozy.
Of course. [noticing Stanley’s arm] That’s weird.  You got a cotton ball and tape and we’ve been using Band-Aids.
[backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.
[on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1–
0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional.
They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. [Dwight walks over]
[puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on Pam’s desk] Buddha this bread for me, won’t you? [Michael and Dwight laugh]
I, I need something to wipe my hand.
Now there’s, there’s butter on my desk.
OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
KGB – [Dwight slaps Michael on the face]
[in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!
What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight]
C’mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That’s it.
I’m not answering that. You answer it.
I’m not gonna answer it, it’s the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]
The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs]
[Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael.
Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.
Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
Why thank you very much. [notices jelly beans] Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!
No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends —
Too many words. Good ideas are simple. ‘Golden ticket.’
No. Jim. We’re a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
Golden Girls. That’s a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it — I don’t get this…
No, you don’t. No, it – [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?
Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
[sighs] You’re making it too easy for her. You’re just conveying, ‘Oh I like you just the way you are.’
But I do like her just the way she is.
[to Kevin] Why don’t you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you’ll know.
You don’t have to wait that long. I mean, you don’t have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.
You’re asking him to give up all of his power.
Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don’t like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I’m a textbook over-thinker.
You can’t let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. ‘Oh I like your dress, but I’d like it more if you had prettier hair.’
That’s psychotic. Do guys actually do that?
[on phone] I’ll take that down right now.
Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips…
…or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
[to Michael] It’s actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
Really? That’s kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?
[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what’s that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn’t.
How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
…well I’m going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn’t lose half my sales.
You didn’t, but… it’ll be fine. It’ll be good.
Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?
I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
OK, I’m going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?
My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody’s golden ticket idea. [sighs] That… [sighs]
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I’m sorry he’s not back from the Civil Rights rally. I’ll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.
When Michael’s skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. ‘Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ‘ ‘An Obama fashion show. ‘ Whatever… that is. Or ‘trapped in an oil painting.’ I’m gonna save that one.
Nobody panic. The good news is… they can’t fire all of us, right?
Oscar, you don’t know what the hell you are talking about.
Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
Alright, then we’re screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so –
So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I’m a little pissed too.
Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes.
Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam’s phone rings]
OK, don’t get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]
I’ve got a golden ticket idea. Why don’t you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He’s having a colonoscopy. Alright, I’ll find out if he’s out yet.
[on phone] Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so–
[on speaker phone] Michael, what the hell is going on here?
[reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We’re going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?
Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don’t… I don’t know.
I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.
[Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
You did. Several times. Over and over again.
[same time as Dwight] No, I don’t think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.
[same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so…
Wasn’t my idea. Loved – but I can’t.
Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.
Yes I do. You’ve just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March… 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.
I wasn’t given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren’t allowed to see movies. So… do the math.
What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary]
Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn’t mine. Discussed movies.
Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
All I’m saying is that it’s a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
I don’t think Jim means to say that you shouldn’t touch her.
[to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it’s really romantic.
[puts hand on Jim’s hand] Like that?
Don’t touch her. Don’t talk to her. Don’t look at her.
[Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] …turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you’re thinking–
No… How skin is the largest organ of the body.
Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.
I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won’t happen again.
I have an idea for a fancy men’s shoe store called Shoe La La. And it’s just men’s shoes for the special occasions in a man’s life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.
May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.
Yes they are, you just don’t care about the information.
I love working here and I do not want to leave.
He doesn’t love it that much. Wouldn’t be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion…
We discussed the fact that I’m cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
That’s it. That’s it. You can’t put a price on freedom.
That’s why you made the decision. That’s why you made…
He said he would do the same for me.
He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
I’m gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn’t it?
David… you’re welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations]
I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute? [everyone starts clapping]
That’s what she said! [David laughs]
Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How’d you come up with that idea?
Really? How did– how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?
[same time as Michael] You never know when it’s gonna strike. Just… boom.
Give me the details of how that happened.
You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you’ve been talking about that movie for years.
And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
[going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.
Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?
[same time as Michael] ‘Cause I’ve got this idea…
Could I be a part of the meeting also?
You probably have too much to do around here. I don’t want to uh, take up your time with another meeting.
Yeah, let’s face it. This meeting sounds like it’s Wonka fans only. He’s never seen the movie. [David laughs]
[on speakerphone] Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away.
OK guys, listen up. Here’s the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it’s metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.
Wait, do you guys hear that? There’s not a dog listening in, is there? [cut to show Michael on the other line] I hear panting.
So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that’s where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].
There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It’s called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
It’s actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
I can’t… vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
[on phone] We are gonna call you back guys. [to Michael] What is going on here?
OK, here’s what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it’s a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?
It is my idea. I’m filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It’s a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
Toilet sponge. It’s a hollowed out sponge…
…that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.
They’re not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
[same time as Michael] Women’s urinals… uh…
[same time as Michael and Dwight] Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?
Yes, it’s Michael’s idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
What, I don’t — what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?
Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.
OK, uhh… I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don’t send me those notes.
When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that’s what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight’s diary]
No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight’s diary from his hand]
Lynn, I’m just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
I think you have the best smile. I’d like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
Nice. [Both laugh] Boobs. [Lynn blushes]
Well, it’s uh, his funeral. So… neh!
Alright. I just got out of the shower, I’ll be one second.
[in accent] When you are done, open the door. … Hello in there?
Yeah, I’m late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it’s a whole routine.
If you want to come back then, that’ll be fine.
We will come back at… how is [looks at watch] 4:45?
Very well, we will come back at 5:15.
Okay, so.  I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door… broken!  So I have to take the normal door.
No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!
He finally has a story everyone wants to hear… and he knows it.
Okay focus. Focus.  You’re in the right building, you’re with the right people; what happened?
I looked at Wallace and I said “I quit!” and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said “You have no idea how high I can fly.”
Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
Well, wouldn’t it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
That he’s wasted 15 years of your life?
You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.
I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream… so…
[Michael has a ‘sticky-hand’ toy and snags a paper off Jim’s desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch. [in Oscar’s ear] Clinky, clinky-clink.  Come-on… come on, come on.
Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?
Pam, what you don’t understand is that at my level you just don’t look in the want-ads for a job.  You are head-hunted.
Any good headhunter knows I am available.
Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
Right, cause that’s what we are talking about.
Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data.
You’re ‘I need you to’ is my command.
You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world. [eats some spaghetti] Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!
I just wanted to tell you that… Oh What?  [takes a present out from behind his back]  What’s that?
Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it’s a farewell…
I hope I get to work with you someday again.
Uh, yes.  Please have a seat. It’ll be a few minutes.
Thank you. [to Michael] You interviewing too?
For regional manager I’ve decided to go with an outside hire.  For obvious reasons.
Yeah, well this is one of the few places that’s hiring.  It’s uh, its brutal out there.
You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today.
Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
During the course of business, a copier goes though something called ‘Normal wear and tear.’
[feeding coins into a vent] I think it’s 75 cents.
[Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!
[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!
Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn’t set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. [holds up a huge manual]
[overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players. [dials phone]
Hi, you’ve reached Prince Paper.  We are sad to inform you that after 40 years of serving the community we are no longer in business.  Thank you for your support. May God bless you. [girl’s voice] Bye!
[sighs] What am I gong to do?  Uh… [chuckles].
Yeah… .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
Okay, oh okay, okay.  Close your eyes.
Just close your eyes. I’m going to start my own paper company.
You’re starting your own paper company?
Can you believe… cause I know paper.  I know everything there is to know about paper.
Do you know the industry is in decline?
Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.
Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes.
No, I did that before, it added nothing.
Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?
Here’s the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they’re set up to do that kind of thing.
Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?
[examining the copier manual] Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
No, I’m sure they’re pretty much the same as the English instructions.
Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.  World War II.
That’s a really… well fine,  Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?
Deutsch… let me see here.  That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.
My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.
Pam, listen.  This order form.  Instead of saying “Dunder Mifflin” at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?
You… oh.  Somebody has been talking in bed.  Pillow talk.
Hmm… yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  ‘Cause it’s a pretty big risk.
This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.
Yeah… you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
Before you got here, I’m the one who landed all these clients.  Half of them, at least. I can do it again.  I know the market, I know the price points.  I’m on it, don’t worry.  So, how do I do that?
Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.
Can’t I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
So that is why I have to leave at 5:
You know, you can run this stuff by Toby.
Yeah I don’t like talking… [knock on door]
I’m sorry, I didn’t realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier.
Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don’t you just…
Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didn’t have any, you know, to stay trim.
Did Michael just let anybody in his office?
Yep! Yeah. He just loved having people, communicating all the time. He was like ‘Come on in!”
I am aware of the effect I have on woman.
So you should be heading back to your desk.
Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well you’ll let me know.  Good bye.
She’s such a special person.  And she’s turning 50 this year.
Yeah.  In all climates.  It’s going to be worldwide.  And I’m looking for some talented salesmen to join me.  That’s where you come in.
Ehh… [in accent] well it’s a very intriguing concept, isn’t it?  Um… hmmm..[makes weird noises to stall, Dwight enters] Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?
Can you believe it? Well, we’ll see, we’ll see. It’s just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so
It’s… it’s very courageous, very exciting. Um…
Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities…
That’s what I was thinking, with the farm, so… You getting to wherever I’m gonna put my thing.
So think about it.  Lets put a pin in it for now.
You know, I would love to put a pin in that.
Everyone, can I have your attention.  This is the moment you’ve all been waiting for. Right? [drum roll on copier]
Meredith…  [copier has an error] Oh… so uh… G-44.  It’s not ready Kevin!
I’m at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.
[bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it]
Just to say “sterile” doesn’t make it so.
I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.
Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
Okay, hey, you already have the job.  You don’t have to convince me.
Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don’t have to answer me now.
Just… I want you to think about it, I’m starting my own company.
Oh-okay, you’re not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.
You know what.  I had a great time at prom.  And no one said ‘Yes’ to that either.
I did it. I learned everything about this machine.  I know all the buttons, even the inside ones.   I know all the error messages.  I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors.  Which feels…
I can’t pretend I haven’t seen that.  So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk  out. And you can’t take anything.
Okay, I have immunity. It’s my two-weeks…
not if you’re starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank…
Hank?  You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you?  Hank, please escort Charles from the building.
I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He’s a good guy.  And he’s super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He’s all the way over there.
[to everyone] Well here we are… I would just like to…
No, no no no.  You’re done, Michael.
[yelling from Parking lot] Alright then everybody, I’m outta here!
[from behind the upstairs window] What is he doing? It looks like he’s saying something.
I can’t believe this is really happening.
And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]
The whole office feels darker, you know?  It’s just a sad dark day.
You don’t have to kiss his ass anymore.
Michael is like a movie on a plane.  You know, it’s not great, but it’s something to watch.  And when it’s over you’re like… how much time is left on this flight? Now what?
[Michael is Army crawling around the office] Michael?
Shh shh shh… don’t look down, look straight up. Come on please!
Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.
Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
I was going to, I wanted to.  But I had to start somewhere.
But you didn’t want to start with us?
No, of course not.  But now I want everybody. Jim!  Jim?  Buddy, Hey!  Buddy, Jimbo?  Did you have time to think about my offer?
I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.
Oh God… okay alright. It’s time to go it’s time to go. Jim, let’s go. Come on!
Hank?  No, I don’t need Hank Michael.
You’re going to mess with me, is that what you’re going to do? I’ll tell you something Charles, I don’t even care. Cause I’ve got nothing got lose. [Charles steps towards Michael] Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it’s not even worth it.
Michael, wait!  I’m coming with you.
Great. Uh, except, I don’t want to be a receptionist anymore.
Alright, okay.  Deal! Okay, well… Jim?
Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so…
Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you…
Jim Jim Jim… we’re having a company meeting here.
I’ll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.
So, we had a personnel change today.  Shouldn’t effect our day to day.  But, until we get a new receptionist I want Kevin on the phones.
Also, there has been too much wasted time.  So Stanley.
Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.
No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
Yeah, I wrote it on my hand… but then I washed it.
It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
Here we go. [Meredith’s phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.]
It is 1-3-4, Kev! [Kevin runs to the phone]
[on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis’s phone rings]
[running to the phone] Just… don’t answer that call!
Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy’s phone rings]
Oh, good. My hooker’s here. [laughs] Hi.
Michael, you were expecting me, right?
Are you wearing anything under the robe?
That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.
Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael’s replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. [Kelly raises hand] Yeah.
Where will you be staying while you’re in Scranton?
Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay. [Andy raises hand] Yeah.
How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day.
Okay, let’s go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? [Charles sees Stanley with his crossword, Charles stares and he puts it away] Thank you. So, umm…
[whispering] Would you please stop that?
Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front.
No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear “yes”.
Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles]
So how you feeling about the new company?
I feel good. [sees a huge pile of French toast] Wow.
Yeah. I’m excited to start the company.
We did that. So, what’s next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second.
Fine! [eggs splatter all over his robe] Oh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
I can’t do this! This is pathetic, isn’t it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.
I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
I don’t think he even uses the bathroom.
[doing situps] I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed –
I know! No, I’m saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.
Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. [Michael doing leg lifts] Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
I’m not getting dressed. I’m not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
He’s everything I’m not and everything I am. He’s the whole package.
Umm… Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I’ve ever met.
He worked at that telemarketing place.
Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
Yeah, I guess it’s not so bad. Got a few things cookin’. [sits down in robe, legs spread wide] Umm…
[laughing at something on his computer]
Oh. Oh my God. I’m so embarrassed. You weren’t supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.
I hate soccer. But guess who doesn’t hate soccer? Charles Miner.
I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!
Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.
I’ve never been a kiss up. I – it’s just not how I operate. I mean, I’ve always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
Oh. Wow. “Michael Scott Paper Company.” Okay. Very official. “Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence.”
No, okay. It’s fine. It’s fine. We’re just gonna add “find office”…
How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
No! No No. No. “My Stumps.” Like “My Humps” but a guy with no legs.
Whoa! And he just goes, “Boom”. [kicking motion] Goal!
I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh… Diego Maradona.
I didn’t know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office.
I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but…
What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?
Well, it’s not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs]
Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. ‘Cause you never, ever talk about it.
Well, maybe you should get back to work.
Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
I don’t try and be anything that I’m not.
What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?
Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.
See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can’t wait!
Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
[Michael comes out with Vikram, arms raised] We got Vikram!
We have a meeting with an investor today.
Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you’ll excuse me, be right back. [gets out of the car] Ah, okay.
Confidence. It’s the food of the wise man but the liquor of the fool.
Hm. I’m looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. [Ryan is working at the bowling alley] It’s Michael.
I’m swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
He’s taking a long time. Is it possible he’s bowling? I mean, you know him better than I do.
Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
[looks at list] When did you add this to the list?
Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
I told you guys, I’m really busy here, so…
Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
[Ryan grabs some shoes] Look what he’s doing.
Hey, c’mon, guys. These are prime selling hours, you know.
Defending duo! He sets him up! [Jim moves the piece of trash with his hands] He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho!
Aw, man, I can’t wait to play with you.
Aw, it’s gonna be the [softly] worst.
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
What sort of investing club is this?
Vikram, you ask a lot of questions and I like that. Hey, Nana! Hi!
People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana’s investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I’m sure that’s what she would have wanted. Does want.
Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
How do you expect to turn a profit in this economy?
By wanting it more. By working hard-
Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows:
C’mon, Oscar. What positions do people play?
Let’s see what you got in those legs!
Alright. [Dwight blows whistle in Jim’s face] No, no, no. That’s supposed to be the kickoff.
Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]
And I offer same day, free delivery.
Nana. [softly] I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don’t – it doesn’t have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other…
We could just give him a chance. It’s not much money.
Well… this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.
This isn’t a handout club. It’s an investment club!
I thought Nana raised some good questions. What kind of a name is Nana?
Oh, sweet Jesus. Look, I’m sorry to do this, but can you drop me back at the telemarketing building?
You know, Michael? You want to succeed? You got to apply the same- [Michael slams door]
Get ‘im, Jim! C’mon, tough D, Jim. [Charles kicks, ball hits Phyllis in the nose]
Phyllis, are you okay? Are, you okay?
Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
Okay, I’m just gonna go get some ice.
Does that make you feel better? Huh?
Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
I can’t do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I – I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that’s why God made so many.
We don’t have any money. We don’t have an office. We don’t have anything.
Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let’s get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay…
How come out of everyone in the office, I’m the only one that went with you? Is it because I’m that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn’t even believe in you!
You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There’s gotta be some sort of secret office that you have… lurkin’ around… some awesome, free, keep it off the books… Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.
I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That’s what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Don’t think a woman can be a man? Well, then that’s your stereotype, not mine.
I could work here. I could see this.
It’s right in the middle of the paper belt.
You know what they say, keep your friends close. [pointing to office sign where “Dunder Mifflin” is listed right above “Michael Scott Pap”]
Hello! They took away my parking space but they can’t take away my pride! [awkwardly climbs out of his car]
I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. [nips mylar ribbon with hedge clippers, it won’t cut, he tears it down] Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!
So. I thought we could take the customer on a… Then. Then we could…
You realize you’re not actually talking to me, right?
Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in]
Okay, I’m gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.
If we’re changing names, can I be Erin? It’s my middle name.
Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy’s name?
We are in the heart of it. [Bathroom sounds rattle the small office.] And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. [He sets sheet between Pam and Ryan on desk. Neither takes it.]
Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we’ll hang out Scranton style.
Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
Please don’t listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she’s like um, she’d probably be a Six in New York, but she’s like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It’s a small space.
Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I’m gonna dive in. To the rundown. I’ll be exhausted ’cause it’s like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
You know there’s a ghost in this office
A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
Yeah isn’t it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you’re next.  [Taps her shoulder]
Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
Oh, this is awkward. [Andy and Erin ‘dance’ trying to get out of each other’s way]
Uh oh! Oh! Oh! [Andy improvs musical verbage]
Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before?
How is it insulting to say that you’re good at something?
Because the thing you’re saying I’m good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
I’m not judging it, it’s like … I could run GM but I couldn’t fix a car. It’s not  saying one is better than the other.
Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
What the hell? [Michael closed his laptop]
Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don’t make copies, I’m the boss. Got it? I make originals.
Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
Not much? What’s up with you? [from bathroom above] Nah it’s okay. I’m in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It’s so good. No, you gotta tune in, it’s as good as anything on HBO. [sound of pissing] Hey does blue go with tan?
I have like, like a blue shirt? I don’t wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
Seriously? This is what’s so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
That’s me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
I don’t want to look at your friend Jasmine’s boobs all day.
You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
They’re getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he’s too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
I’m on the phone, please. Mom, I’m gonna have to call you back. P’s being a giant B.
Give it back for what? What’re you gonna do with it?
You’re gonna make another “spreadsheet.”
They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?
Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I’m assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
Look you’ve been here longer, and besides, I’m a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-
Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.
Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
Okay. There are … 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right?  1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
No, you’re supposed to say, “Rock the house.”
Hey dude, you know what a “rundown” is?
“Uh, can you get this rundown for me?” [impersonating Charles]
“This rundown better be really good”?
I don’t know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
No. I can’t. It was like, hours ago.
No, this is where I work. I can’t relax in the same corner where I work.
So my corner’s the one with the copier?
Pam, I don’t make the rules. [Pam walks out.]
Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don’t want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
You started on that rundown yet?  [Looks at Jim’s screen.]
Oh, this is just something I’m taking a break with.
I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you’re looking for ?
Keeping it simple -that’s what I’m doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
I know you’re a very busy man so I’ll cut right to the chase. I’d like my old job back.
I don’t know what to tell you. The job’s been taken.
Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.
Well it was great catching up with you. And I’ll see you around the building.
I’m just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that’s okay. The air smells so good. I don’t remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?
Thank you. You remember Ryan [Stanley laughs deeply] And Pam is around here somewhere.
I don’t know. [They shrug and leave.]
Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That’ll show ’em.
Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary. [Flips a pancake. It’s about 8×11 inches] Young sir, would you like a free pancake?
I’m texting. I don’t want to get my fingers sticky.
Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you’re the face of this company.
You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
That’s as specific as I’d like to be.
Well, at least you’re still being honest with me.
There’s the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren’t prepared for.
Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.
Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my…?
The one I have. I’ll use the one I have.
We’re small, but we’re eager to make a name for ourselves.
Nope, I don’t have a card, but I’ll do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
Well I don’t even want these. [Takes the rectangle pancakes out of his coat.]
Country roads, take me home, to the place…[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You’re good!
That was great, but it’s just sort of, it’s still a little choppy like. But don’t worry, it’s hard, it took me a while too. It’s like [Andy plays Country Roads on his banjo.]
What? Oh my God you heard that I’m so embarrassed. I’m like so rusty.
Oh it’s good, you’re coming along. It’s really technically proficient but really there’s no heart or soul in it.
Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven…
West Virginia, Blue Ridge mountain, Shenandoah River [Andy vocalizes]
In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
Take me home, country roads, to the place, I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads. [Erin leaves]
Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
You have to stop. [bangs on glass window]
Dunder Miff…Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we’d like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
Don’t tell them we have free delivery! [Also whispers]
Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do… just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! ‘Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Dancing in the office]
Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
Hup! [throws cheese puff to Pam who catches it in her mouth]
Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for… several years. Wait, no, that can’t be right.
Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
This is my solo. [stereo plays Andy imitating bass guitar, a cappella starts singing ‘You Can Call Me Al’]
I’m confused. Am I walking down the aisle to ‘You Can Call Me Al?’
Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch… $9,000.
I don’t know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
Doesn’t Charles know he’s compromising my attack readiness? It’s not a dress code. It’s a death sentence.
‘Kay, thank you. It’s a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay.
When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody’s worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
Hey. Ed’s Tires is thinking of making a change.
[gestures to ‘Bed & Breakfast’ magazine] Is this good?
Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?
Wh-  I don’t need $6 to help a friend.
No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
Michael, you know I can’t take this.
That was four years ago. Why don’t you let it go?
What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?
I think she just didn’t want a crucifix cake.
It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.
When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.
It’s so scary how right the things you’re saying are. And you’re coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
I know a few things about love.  Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.
I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
Ed’s Tires. Why don’t you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
Bring it in. Morning cheer. [clears throat]
U-G-L-Y, you ain’t got no alibi! You ugly, huh huh, you ugly! You mama says you ugly! Hey! Go Michael Scott Paper Company!
I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
Nah, that’s weird. You’re gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin’ lately?
Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
I’ve just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn’t go unnoticed.
Yeah, I like your work ethic. You’re so… focused.
And I wanna start givin’ you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
[on phone] I need you to get me the prices that you’re charging Ed’s tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
I don’t know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something’s come up.
Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It’s not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they’re changing fast.
Imagine… Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there’s this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I’m getting your drift.
Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you’re writing?
Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying “He’s talking about you!”]
[Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us?
It is possible that I could be talking about us.
Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
It is the situation that we are in now.
So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don’t you?
Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
Hey, Andy. You know I’ve been thinkin about what you said-
That’s interesting, because I hear what you’re saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I’m like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I’m so happy. I’m so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?
It’s just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I’m pretty emotionally needy.
And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim’s fist] Ah, what’d you do that for?
[both laugh] You know that I was doin’ this.
Hello, Dwight. What’s with the shirt? Are you alright?
[Charles comes from around corner] Hi, Michael.
Oh my God! Run! Run! It’s a setup. Setup!
We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you’ve been pestering him for company info.
I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I’m okay with it.
Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
It’s like, a girl says she’ll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
We can’t help you if you don’t just tell us what happened.
I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don’t know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don’t know. Is that clear enough for you?
[Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.
Yeah, well, with you it’s different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
Why? When I look in the mirror, I don’t like the face that looks back.
I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]
I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. [hangs up] Bill Cosby.
If you’d like to reach an outside line, please dial nine first. [Michael sighs, hangs up phone]
So, you think Michael’s going after the whale, huh?
I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I’m not worried.
And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we’re all making observations! [gibberish sounds]
Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So it’s not exactly like ‘Highlander,’ but still…
Hello, Dwight, I’ve been expecting your call. What do you want?
So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There’s no-
Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
You have two seconds. [Dwight starts running]
[looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.
I hope you’re not recording this conversation. [Dwight drops his pants and lifts up his shirt] Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
You were making me do things that were not all right.
So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo’s.
[Michael, Ryan and Pam sitting at restaurant, phone rings] Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
Oh, hi, Michael. I’m so sorry I’m late. I got stuck in traffic.
Really? That’s weird. We didn’t see any.
He’s technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael’s office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael’s desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]
Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He’ll be here in a sec.
[Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat.
Oh my God, I think we’ve been robbed!
No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You’re still stuck in traffic. [Pam holds up sign saying “Dwight did it!!”] You?
You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you’ve created. You have unleashed the wolf!
Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
Oh. [bites into sandwich, looks disgusted] Bastard!
Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don’t say.
[holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, “great salesman, better friend.” [turns card over] “Tall” and “beets.”
And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you’re begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.
If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
This is war and that is what happens.
Oh, one more thing. I’m going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
Oh, uh oh, I’m turning you down right now.
You can hear me, but I can’t hear you.
Mr. Schofield’s ready to see you now, Mr. Scott.
Oh, great. Mr. Schofield’s ready to see me. Thank you so much.
Don’t let him in! He’s a traitor! Michael!
Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I’m closing the door. [Dwight runs out of the office]
[on speakerphone in Dwight’s car] Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.
Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]
Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin’ here?
Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don’t think you’re ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.
What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
It’s not the soil! It’s the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office]
I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our-
La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
I’m going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin…
Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
What he’s not telling you is that he will abandon you.
Why don’t you guys just e-mail me your best offers and we can finish it up that way?
That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how’s your gay son?
I color code all my info. I wrote “gay son” in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means “Orange you glad you didn’t bring it up?” Most colors mean “Don’t say it.”
How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can’t make you feel good, then I don’t want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.
Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners.
He’s undercutting us big time. He’s actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.
That’s my family. When you mess with my family, I can’t be responsible for my actions.
When are you ever responsible for your actions?
Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.
Betrayal ain’t just a river in Egypt.
Who is that knocking on my taste buds? Why, it’s Mr. Lemon. Hmmm, nice to meet you.
It’s good. But won’t it feel weird cutting into a cross?
Don’t think of it as a cross in the Judeo-Christian sense, think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage.
When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me.
Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
We’ve been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I’ve gotten clean there’s something about fresh morning air that… just really makes me sick.
Hello! Time to make the donuts!  Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!  [laughs] Hey Pam.
We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says “Alleluia Church of Scranton.” in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.
You didn’t happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?
Oh, awesome.  You’re a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
We’re, uh, we’re doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, we’re having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20– of those.
[an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It’s, uh, it’s a paper company now.  It’s not for the church.
No, they were your client.  They just called and told us they’re switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company.
[sighs] Shame, Jim.  I expected more.
In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.
What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.
I don’t want to hear excuses.  I want to see improvements.  This is unacceptable.
Hey, Boss. Uh, I’d just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys.
I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.
Is this something you really want to have said?
I don’t want to have said that.  But I think it’s important that you know it.
I don’t know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it’s my fault-
It’s not your fault. Some people just don’t want to be inspired.
I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh–
Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I’m putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.
You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.
Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.
Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top.
Most dorm rooms don’t even have that.
Let’s see what a delivery guy costs.
We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.
Would you let Charles know that David is here, please?  Jim, hey.
David Wallace! Hello, we’ve been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.
There he is. There he is.  How was the trip up?
A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I’m sure.
Oh, you know it hasn’t been that bad.  Hasn’t been that bad.  These people are the salt of the earth down here.  You couldn’t ask for a better way to learn a company.
I feel like I should be thanking you.
The conference room is ready if we want to get started.
You know, I just want to address everyone first.
Oh yeah, take your time.  Stanley, pay attention.
Hello.  Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business.  And I’m here– I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.
Maybe, and I don’t know, if you had just returned Michael’s call none of us would’ve lost clients.
I’ve been wondering that myself lately.  We’re just gonna get started, we’re gonna figure this out. Rest assured.  Jim, can you come in with us please?
Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight’s been my guy.  Okay?
I find that extraordinarily surprising.
He shows promise and Jim, I don’t know– I– he’s been a disappointment.
Okay, great.  Uh, Dwight come on in.  Also, Jim.
How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
Well, if these numbers you gave me are correct–
Then you can’t afford to pay him anything.
Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss.
Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin can’t match your prices?
Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
Yeah, with a fixed cost pricing model that’s correct.
But you need to use a variable cost pricing model.
Okay, sure. Right, so– why don’t you explain what that is to– so that they can under– just explain what that is.
As you sell more paper and your company grows, so will your costs. For example, delivery man, health care…
At these prices, the more paper you sell, the less money you’ll make.
Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
They’re actually putting you out of business.
Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.
It’s a program.  There’s no such thing–
Just crunch ’em.  Just crunch ’em please.
When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don’t blame the child.  He didn’t know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, “Drive, kid.  I trust you.”
Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
I say we fill Michael’s office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.
[scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]
Fellas, why don’t we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.
Okay.  Hey, Dwight.  Can I talk to you?
[opens phone] Hey. I saw you called.
We have maybe a month.  I don’t know what I’m gonna do.
Oh, yeah, well don’t worry about it.  We’ll figure it out.  We’ll be okay.
Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight’s voice saying “Idiot, Idiot, Idiot”] Oh, that’s my new “Dwight” ring.
[over phone] Idiot, we’re starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.
Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don’t worry about it.
Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  It’s this.
So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding’s really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of ’em called me back.  Not even for an interview.
Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
Now, this is the projection over three months?
We still have the inventory sitting– [everyone starts chattering at once]
Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say– can I say something?
There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but the cheapest option… is to make Michael an offer.
Yes.  Yes, I was gonna say the same thing.  We should buy him out.
Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That’s how you really apply the pressure.
Jim, you’re– you’re pretty close with him.  You think they’d be up for hearing an offer?
Oh, I don’t know. You know, they’ve taken a good deal of clients, so–
I mean I guess– I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
You know what?  Why don’t I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I’m the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?
Okay, so I’ll be back in, um– back in a bit.
Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Listen, I can’t make you laugh right now.
You know I love a good guessing game, but why don’t I just tell you what I’m here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Jim, what you don’t understand is that this company’s worthl–
Oh!  See I’m here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
Yes, well, we’re not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we’re broke.
That we’re having any problem at all.
Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.
Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we’re broke.
Oh, I’m really worried that I’m going to say it.
We have to come from a position of strength.
Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe we’re expected.  [David and Charles walk out of conference room] Well, well, well. How the turntables…
Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.
And we are prepared to reject that offer.
Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer?
Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don’t even want to hear what your first offer was.
Okay, now I don’t know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How’s about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael?
Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside.  Take your time.
Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you’re leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles.
May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
They’ve been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They’re desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They’re total failures.
No, I mean, great detective work.  ‘Cause this must be the first case you’ve ever cracked, right?
You don’t crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That’s like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I’ve solved plenty.
Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.
Okay, do  not go anywhere near the conference room.
Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today.  Got it?
So you’ve thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?
Can you give us another minute please?
How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
Why are you assuming you’d get the whole thing?
It’s a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn’t you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?
I would rather have $60,000, honestly.
No, Michael’s right.  Jobs are safer.
I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring.
I am not firing Charles.  He is very valuable.
That’s very kind of you to say, David.
Uh, you already have a new receptionist–
Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it’s heyday.
Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael.  Ryan is–
You know, David.  I don’t care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.
Do you realize what you’re asking for here?  You’re talking about salary plus health benefits–
Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You’re talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.
Your company cannot be worth that much.
That’s one of ’em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court.
Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds]
Yes! Can you believe it?  That’s what I’m talking about!
[whispering] It’s Michael Scott.  [applause; Michael jumps through sign] Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes.
[after a few moments of silence]  Wh–what are you doing?
If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
Take it up with Toby.  What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward.  And I want you to reflect.  And I want you to say something different.
Not important. [everyone mutters] Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.
It’s going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and–
You mean the clients you stole from us.
Yeah , aren’t we getting those clients back?
You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
Okay, Dwight.  Let me explain something to you.  I set the rules and you follow them.  Blindly. Okay?   And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.  It’s a trash can.
[to Ryan] Don’t fall in love with me, kid.
[laughs]  Boscov’s at the Steamtown Mall?
It sure looked good on the mannequin.
Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
Isn’t that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn’t have enough time for them?
Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.
The man is wearing sandals.  I don’t need to see Oscar’s toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
Can’t you just not look at his feet?
Excuse me? Oh. You’re so educated, aren’t you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don’t want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!
Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out ’cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldn’t say I have a passion for H.R.
[hands Ryan a soda] There you are, my friend.
Trust me, Stanley,  you’re going to want to read this memo very carefully.
I am not changing the way I do my files.
No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.
I’m sorry you’re offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
No, they’re clean.  I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.
Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
What are you still doing not at your desk?
All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order–
No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.
Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.
We’re in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I’m not convinced that Michael and Pam didn’t have a thing going while they were gone.
Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
You don’t take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she’s very pretty.
Her face is okay, but– Jesus!  What –what are you doing here?
I don’t know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something–
Get out!  We need to do something.  I’m thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
No, I’m not saying we do those things.  I’m saying something like those things.
We could write a strong-worded letter.
Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
Oh.  Well, that–that’s a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we’ll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I’ll see everyone upstairs.
C’mon. [whispers]  Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I’m talking action–
Yeah, I think you’re going to want to cool it with that ’cause it’s starting to upset the other salesmen.
I will–no, no.  I’ll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be–but definitely is–a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
It’s gotta be because they all want their clients.
The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott.  They are in for a bitter surprise.  I am not to be truffled with.
Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.  You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
It’s crazy what’s going on out there today, huh?
Sometimes it’s best just to say out of it.
I had a salmon salad.  With water, no ice.  I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it.  Her name was Flo, she had black hair.
So since you guys already ate, you won’t be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?  [walks into kitchen] Oh, wow, Stanley.  Is that egg salad?  Andy brought some salmon.
Dwight, is that a meat sandwich?  You guys hungry?
I’m going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
Hey, Meredith.  Can I talk to you privately for a second?
You–you might consider pulling it down a touch.  It’s ri–it’s riding up a little high.
A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar’s allowed to wear sandals,  but I’m not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?
Fine.  [pulls dress up, everyone gasps again]
Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties?
It’s casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]
[playing chess with Jim]  No. IF you do that, I’m gonna do that.  IF you do that, I’m gonna do that.  IF you do this, I’m gonna do that.
I’m just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He’s winning.  I feel like I’m describing a dream I had.
I’m sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.
Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
Give me the phone.  Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
Hey, it’s Dwight here.  Give me the phone.
You’re not gonna find this anywhere else.
Dwight Schrute here.  Hey, don’t hang up.
I know times are tough right now,  and I laud your thriftiness. [tries to pull phone out of Ryan’s hand] Ryan!
Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!
You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time.  It’s okay, Ryan.
You’re a secretary! What do you know?
And you’re a temp and I’m taking your phone.   I’m confiscating this.
Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.
We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We’ll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance…Stanley Paper Company.
Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view…98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  I’m the bad guy.
I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?
I don’t know that first things about secret meetings.
Thank you so much for saying that.  I can’t believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.
If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  “apology accepted”, I think we would all feel better.  And then we can break out  my gift to you–complimentary white chocolate bark.
Nobody likes that stuff except for you.
They wouldn’t make it unless people liked it.
Michael, just give us our clients back.  That’s all we care about.
Okay.  If I give you your clients back there won’t be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
Fine, have your clients.  I can see that’s what you wanted all along.  [everyone mutters “okay”] However, I rescind my apology.
You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
What’d I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there’s not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  He’ll make his decision by the end of the day.
I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
Oh.  I think you should get it.  You’ve changed a lot and you’d be good at it.
If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
So hey, I’m want to set you up with my daughter.
Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.
[puts Scrabble pieces on board] And Bingo was his name.  Let’s go.
I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
I don’t want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
Eh, she’s nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he’s my number one choice.
Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
You didn’t hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious ’cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
I like her.  I think that she is a fast learner.  Cons, she doesn’t always follow through.  Sh–New York and the whole art school thing.  And Roy.  She has a weird voice.
I think she’d be a really good salesperson.
I don’t think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven’t said one bad thing about Pam.
Okay.  So be it, then you’ve lost credibility.  And I’m going to go with my guy, and that’s Ryan.
All right.  You’re right, sometimes when she’s tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that’s not a weird voice.
Ho-ho, man!  Wow. [in a high-pitched voice] Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  ‘Cause I’m not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba–
I have a very difficult decision to make.  It’s like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie’s Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
You don’t understand clothing, Toby.  You’re dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.
All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.
Listen up, Flenderson.  You’re being weak and ineffectual.  I’m cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
It’s not.  It’s not.  Sit down or I am writing you up.
Casual Fridays are cancelled.  [everyone protests]  Let’s just not do it anymore.
There’s not a single appropriate outfit in this whole–except mine, quite honestly.
Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.  [clears throat] Well, there’s no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just…drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been–
I gave Ryan the sales job.  There just weren’t enough clients for the two of you.  So I had to–
Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?  [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this– did I get the job?
No, you’re the best person for the job.  You’re going to be great.
You should have seen your face.  Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
Oh. [laughing] I really thought I didn’t get it.
Oh, man.  That was really good.  That was really good.
I don’t know, I offered him his temp job back.  We’ll see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn’t get the job, so–
Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn’t fake fire people anymore.
I don’t appreciate you telling me what to do.  So clean out your desk, you are through here.
[opens door] Erin.  Michael wants to see you.
This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.  [pick up phone] Hank, could you come up here please?  Hank is our security guard–
He will be ushering you out.  [starts laughing]
No, I’m kidding.  No, you’re not–you’re not fired.  Yet.
Not cool, Dwight. [Dwight continues laughing]
Guys, I’m scared. I’m really scared. I think I’m growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
Oh, I can’t do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
What about the rest of you? [complete silence]
I don’t do lunch. I’m eating five small meals a day now.
Now that I’m back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
No. I don’t want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
Ugh! God! What happened to you people? [talking like a robot] We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work… is work.
If you don’t take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
[still talking like a robot] I… was just learning… to… love.
Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court –
So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
So, it turns out it’s the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
Ok. So, we’re going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that’s great but then you have to invite –
Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ” You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.”
I had just woken up. I didn’t look cute. That’s how I knew he meant it.
Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
If you ever want to come down here, door’s always open, lock’s broken, so…
Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?
Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There’s no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.
Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster’s People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don’t know. It’s like [pause] Dave died or something.
Daddy’s here and daddy is going to take care of you.
Please don’t refer to yourself as our daddy.
I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
Daddy’s here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
Funk is the problem and the solution.
I’ve taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
Why don’t you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
[Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?
No. Dwight is confusing you. That – it’s, it’s more of a disco.
… with coffee but without the haunted.
It’s a combo dance house coffee bar.
It’s a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
Wha – No. No. Not even close. I can’t force you to go down but I can entice you. I’m gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time… and all-you-can-eat espresso.
Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.
Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There’s no cookie. There’s no cookie. Come on. Come.
Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you’re just some terrible monster.
[Michael is holding the stereo speaker up to a vent – blaring “[Gonna Make You Sweat] Everybody Dance Now”, spins in chair] Oww!
Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
It’s pretty important. He wouldn’t want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?
Tell him I’m going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
[starts dancing with Phyllis] Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
You didn’t do that. You’re ok. You’re ok. Let’s lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
Ok. That’s ok. That’s not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who’s Phillip?
Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
It’s her back. We just – We need – Let’s – You know what?
We’re going to take care of you. We’re gonna get you help. Let’s – come on.
Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
I don’t need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
It’s just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
[barging through office door] Alright. Here we go.
What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we’re going to put you in here. Dwight’s going to take care of you.
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
Oh, you know. Nohting. She’s  – we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she’s a tough, old bird. So…
Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don’t think she would trade that memory for anything. [Phyllis can be heard screaming in the backgroud]
I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
I don’t care. Bury it. I hope you’re happy.
[exits the conference room in an undershirt] I’m gonna need two able bodied men.
You’re bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music – start dancing]
I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.
You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?
Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn’t doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It’s the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It’s like children singing Christmas carols.
Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
I’ve been here 8 years and I’ve never… [Erin walks away] Rude.
I’m not sure, but I’m pretty sure I’m in a dance off. Alright!
Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.
Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
No. I didn’t come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
No. No. No. Here is the deal – one signature for every song.
Look, I hate to be “that” person but I just don’t like the general spirit of music.
This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
Hey, thank you, Creed. you’re really getting this place.
No problem. I’ll just have no idea who’s driving behind me now.
No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]
When I say it out loud it’s so silly. [they both laugh]
Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!
You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
[waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.
We should probably stop by. It’d mean a lot to him.
Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It’s really happening.
Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
You can’t steal what is legally your property.
What dance competition? I was just dancin’ casual with my friends, y’all.
You guys are the best for coming. You don’t have to stay if you don’t want to. I understand.
Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! [Dwight hits Michael in ear] Hey! Come on, man. It’s not even to “Y”.
Yeah. I think maybe I want a “wedding” wedding.
No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.
You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
I, I – but you’re not a professional and I’m thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.
I’m doing it. No. I’m doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I’m gonna mess up.
Are you sure that’s not the “gay” ear?
Hi. Did you have bacon for breakfast?
I didn’t think I did. How’s everything going?
Tight. I’m going down the hall to this office to see Michael – there’s free espressos.
I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.
Are you sure that you didn’t eat bacon?
Yes, I had some bacon this morning. I just didn’t think it was anyone’s business.
I love the smell of bacon on a woman.
Hey, Lynn, it’s Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.
It is hard to imagine you playing softball.
I was all-county my junior and senior years.
Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.
[whispering] Okay, I’m gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
[whispering] What do you need from me?
[mumbles in his sleep as Pam and Jim change the clocks in his office]
[changing the clock in Michael’s car] Like clockwork.
[silently counting] Three, two, one… [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]
[wakes up, joins in with the laughter] Uh oh. What’s so funny?
Oh yay! Geography joke. [still laughing, notices the time] Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let’s all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates gunfire] Yeah!
[at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?
Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?
Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]
Oh, don’t get us wrong, we like picnics.
I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
Yeah, you don’t grab these [gestures to her chest] for balance.
Ah, 40. Insect repellent, which we clearly need, reduces the effectiveness of SPF.
Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh]
Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
We’re just friends. [approaches Holly and AJ] Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
Oh no, I see they’re letting just anybody in here.
All right. Mmhmm. [both start laughing and hug] Hey.
A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
Hey. [hugs AJ a little too forcefully] Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
You can go to hell. [laughs] I’m kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I’m going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one:
Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest. [walks away]
I don’t get it. He’s not even my boss anymore.
Do you want me to beat him up for you?
No, I shouldn’t have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
Listen up everyone! I’ve gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim’s whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
Well, I could’ve died, so… I looked it up online afterwards.
Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?
Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
I’ll tell you what, I’m gonna do you one better. I’m gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
Wow… I’m designing a chair. It’s part of your pants. You sit down, you’re supported.
I remember your chair pants idea. [laughs]
I like that. Put me down for a pair. I’m a size 34 waist.
All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.
Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
[in a New York accent] Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
[playing volleyball, yelling at Erin, who hit the ball out of bounds] Are you blind?! Are you blind?! [turns attention to a man on the other team] Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I’m concerned you might be in danger.
These are expensive Ray-Bans, jackass.
Okay, I was just looking out for you. [to Erin] You’re doing great, by the way.
[playing volleyball] I got it. [Kevin misses]
Can you see things with your eyeballs?!
It’s not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let’s focus! Come on, you’re better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
We’ve been out here for a while. I don’t need this.
[playing volleyball, Ryan hits the ball away, not paying attention to the game] Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand’s on the net.
Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you’re right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
Back off, Dwight. [serves] Hyuh! [the opposing team misses the ball, the Scranton team cheers] What?
Maybe I played a little in junior high… and in high school… maybe a little in college… and went to volleyball camp most summers.
[serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win!
[to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs]
I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
Do you have a script for the sketch, or…
Um, no, I just thought we’d wing it. That cool?
[Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
You weren’t even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub!
I don’t hear cheaters, tramps, or women who break my friend’s heart. Let’s go!
[gasps] We could do Back to the Future.
We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time… fix their parents. [both laugh]
Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
Oh! [to the theme of “Jaws”] Dun-der. Dun-der…
Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!! [both laugh]
Oh… We haven’t found our great idea yet.
[playing volleyball, Scranton wins another game] Nicely done. We’re still going to crush you though!
You suckers are goin down! They’re gonna wipe their asses with your serves! Piss all over your faces!
Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- [shouts of disapproval]
Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall.
Oh yeah, with Bernie and Efrem. That was hilarious.
Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug]
Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
[shouts from behind the trees] Uh, it’s a sketch now.
Okay, introducing Scranton’s Michael Scott performing with Nashua’s Holly Flax! I have not seen this. [applause]
[imitates Who Wants To Be a Millionaire theme music as both sit in folding chairs]
Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?
For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
Ohh, I’m thinking… I’m going to say… B, tour of Dartmouth College.
That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael]
[screams] Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
[now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you’ll get in?
Yeah, I’m definitely getting in. I’m a shoo-in.
I’m Robert Mifflin. [pause to see audience’s response] Ah, okay. [both run back to chairs]
Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I’ve ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
I usually don’t enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
[over crowd of murmurs] What is he talking about?
[pantomimes biting off Michael’s fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!
Uh, okay everyone, we’re at a picnic today…
Are we losing our jobs or not, David?
I’m sorry, this certainly wasn’t the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.
We’re- we’re closing the Buffalo branch.
[over shouts of protest] You’ve got to be kidding me! You’ve got to be kidding me! We’re the best branch in the company! I can’t believe it. [Michael and Holly bow]
How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
Well… I didn’t know they didn’t know.
What about the fact that they’re here today? What about that? That didn’t throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, “oh, this would be really funny.”
Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, “is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?”
Well, he’s just thinking about his own gifts.
Maybe we shouldn’t play due to the circumstances.
Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
Because if we don’t play, then the other team wins.
Dwight’s right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
[playing volleyball] Jim, come on! [Jim scores a point, Scranton cheers]
Look who just woke up! [laughs, scores a point on the next play] I’ve been up for a while.
It’s six to six. It’s a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]
Kevin! Now it’s seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
Here’s an accounting question for you:
What? She is sitting there, casting aspersions-
[hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!
Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.
No, no, it’s fine. Just gimme a second.
I don’t know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?
All right, you know what? You’re just trying to get rid of our best player.
Oh, Jim, you’re putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance’s health.
Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let’s go, it’s our ball. Let’s go!
Yeah, I don’t think we can let you play with that foot.
[whispering] Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I’ll stall ’em.
All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let’s do this.
Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I’ll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]
Probably shouldn’t have mentioned Buffalo.
How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
I think it went well. I think it was good.
Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
Me too. [long pause] We have a lot of good material for next year’s sketch.
[on the phone] Yeah, she’s with the nurse right now, so you’ll have to stall a little longer… No, don’t send in the subs yet… Dwight, I don’t know. Think of something!
Oh, shouldn’t be too bad, it’s a slow day. So, no other radiation this year, no metal plates, no chance you’re pregnant…
I’m sorry, can we just hurry this up? I’ve got a game to get back to.
Oh good, because my next question was “do you have a game to get back to.”
I loved it. You know, there was a part near the end that seemed like that went on a little long, but…
Well you guys should hit the road before… I close down another branch.
Dwight, come on now, it’s time to put in the subs.
Yeah, it looks like Pam won’t make it back. Okay?
Except, you know what? It’s not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
[walking on Pam’s desk, then Jim’s desk] Extreme! Parkour!
[stands on his hands kicking open bathroom doors as Andy films, Meredith is seen applying deodorant in women’s bathroom]
[approaching elevator, as Michael films] Parkour! Parkour!
Andy! Leapfrog! [Andy leapfrogs Dwight]
Yeah! [Dwight jumps on Andy’s back, riding him like a horse] Parkour! Parkour!
[walking across cars in parking lot, Dwight filming] Parkour! Parkour!
[crouching beside car] Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera! [Michael feebly attempts to jump off car, gives double thumbs up to camera]
[standing on tractor trailer with Dwight and Andy, looking down] Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.
Here it is, here it is… truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, [camera pans to refrigerator boxes, then dumpster] 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.
[to Michael’s camera] Hardcore Parkour!
[leaps from trailer, disappears into empty refrigerator box]
[look down, appearing shocked and concerned]
[inside refrigerator box, sounding injured] Parkour!
[on telephone] Good. Excellent. Thank you.
[hands Dwight a cup of water] There you go. Is there anything else I can do?
[chugs water, throws away cup] Yes. Umm… see those files behind Kevin’s desk?
Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
[to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him?
I bet there’s something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
If they get married before I do, I’m going to kill myself.
[entering break room] Who’s getting married?
If somebody doesn’t tell me, I’m gonna start screaming.
Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.
They’re not getting married. It’s just talk.
Did everybody know about this but me?
There’s nothing to know, it’s just gossip.
[shaking head disgustedly] Okay… okay. [leaves room]
[talking head with Jim] We haven’t told anyone I’m pregnant.
Well, with her being unmarried… knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
Yeah, we don’t want them at the wedding thinking Jim’s being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.
Wait, there’s not gonna be a shotgun?
No shotgun… ’cause that changes everything.
What are you gonna do about it? There’s no shotgun, so… free at last, free at last!
[approaches Dwight’s desk] You’ll never guess what I know.
[typing] Okay, let me finish this thought.
[still typing] He most definitely does. He’s been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.
[still typing] People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it’s because of my low cheekbones. And… boom. [finishes typing, turns to face Michael] Okay, what is it, what can’t I guess?
I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it’s not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn’t exist. Or that the sport doesn’t exist? I should’ve known. Poopball?
[to Maurie, the Asian intern] Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said “The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle.”
I’m talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.
[confused] Stanley was on your group date?
No, Stanley was with his wife. I waved at him, but he didn’t wave back.
[laughs] Does anybody else know about this?
There he goes. There he goes. [Stanley gets up from his desk, walks into kitchen area]
So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?
Nothing? Well I got a little somethin’ somethin’. I don’t know if I should say…
Stanley’s way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.
Teri, Stanley’s wife. She’s at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
[starts to speak, says nothing, walks away]
[entering break room, to Maurie] You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.
If that was his sister, then what they were doing was totally illegal.
[fumbling for words] Mmm… okay. Uhh… hmm… okay. Never mind. Carry on.
[approaching Kelly’s desk, whispering] Stanley is having an affir.
[motioning to pad of paper with hangman game, spelling out  “S_an_ey is chea_in_ _n _eri] That and that are the same letter.
No… no. He’s holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What’s that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven’t you guessed?
T! Yes! Yes! That is a “T”, and there’s another one right there. Just sound that out. You’re almost there.
[opening blinds as Stanley walks past] Hey, Stanley! Where you goin’, big guy? Up to no good?
I’m meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I’m casting a movie and I’m looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?
Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.
[approaching Michael] You have to stop this.
[giddy, whispering] Did you hear Stanley’s having an affair?
I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it’s really sad because everybody thinks you’re a loser…
Do you know if it’s true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
[stares at Jim silently, then walks away]
[in parking lot, blocking path of Stanley’s car] Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real. [Stanley honks horn repeatedly] Stanley, are you having an affair?
[as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?
So It’s not true. Okay, well… ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just… racial profiling gossip.
[hits steering wheel angrily] Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.
It’s just that… Teri’s been traveling a lot…
Cynthia’s been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill… I didn’t…
Wait, hold, hold, hold… so it IS true?
Yeah, but Michael, I’m going to go break it off. That’s where I’m headed right now. I swear.
Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they’re going on sales calls and then go someplace else? ‘Cause that’s not cool.
I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.
[muttering] I’m not saying… a damn thing.
[looking afraid] You can count on me.
[entering kitchen area] Oh, that smells good.
I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.
Did you hear about Angela? That’s pretty weird.
Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno’s on the turnpike.
Uh huh. [gestures to Kevin to keep it quiet] Alright?
Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.
[to Kelly] I’m worried about Erin, because she’s not a very good worker. I don’t know how long she’s gonna last here.
[whispering to Meredith] Did you hear Pam is pregnant?
[making a cup of tea in kitchen area]
[sarcastically] Oh, I bet you like it.
Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!
Do you like it as much as you like mens’ butts?
[serious] Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?
[to Oscar in break room] Did you hear the rumor about me? That I’m gay?
Do you think it’s true? Do you think that I’m… gay?
Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he’s like really aggressive?
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still… need to get to you?
It’s not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it’s like, not a fantasy, it’s just… it’s just a scenario.
Wow. I wish… I wish I could help you. I don’t… you might be gay. You might be gay.
What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can’t possibly fall to me.
A few months, that’s why they’re rushing the wedding.
[whispering] Guys, guys… you can’t believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It’s just… there’s no stalking it. It’s a weird day for false facts. Let it go.
[with everyone assembled in conference room] Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff… who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.
[giving envelopes to interns] Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I’ve attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.
[grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can’t call me at all. Problem solved.
[to Eric] You’re gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
[eating cake with Kelly] I am so happy you’re eating again.
[to Jim] Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?
Oh, I don’t really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
Are you… interested in her guy friends?
No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women.
But off the record, I’m kinda confused.
Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like…
Alright. [looks around uneasily] Well hey…
[chuckles] Come on… little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.
[to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?
[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?
[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.
I didn’t tell anyone! Who did you tell?
[approaching Jim and Pam] Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don’t, and if it gets out, they won’t let me scuba.
If I can’t scuba, then what’s this all been about? What am I working toward?
[to Andy] What? You think I’m the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
[to Phyllis and Stanley] What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?
Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
[entering conference room] Yeah, yeah… you know what? Let’s discredit these rumors.
Yeah, sure, but… who’s been saying all that stuff?
That’s not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn’t listen to any of that crap.
Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let’s pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.
I need to do mine first. Who’s been saying that there’s another person inside of me, working me with controls?
[approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He’s over here!
Michael… [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]
Don’t get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator]
[to everyone, in conference room] Okay, I made it all up.
But guys, I’m a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I’m a J. Crew model.
Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.
Because a lot of people think that models, even though they’re very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It’s set our industry back quite a bit.
Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley’s affair, me being a spokesdog…
[pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?
Okay, okay… here’s the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn’t want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
Well then, what’s the one true rumor?
[sighs] The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person’s life, is that…
I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought “Oh, she has a new bra with padding.” But then I thought “Pam doesn’t need padding.” It just didn’t add up, Jim.
Alright, alright… you know, this is not the truth, and you can’t fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.
[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
If everyone would like to see proof.
Are we just gonna wait here? [Pam returns, displays sonogram]
Look at that! [grabs sonogram from Pam] That is the inside of your vagina! [Jim takes sonogram from Michael]
[talking head with Jim] It’s clear why we were trying not to tell people. That’s clear now. [Jim nods, looking at floor]
[to Jim and Pam] How long have you known about the pregnancy?
Michael, we only told our parents last week.
[exchanges looks with Jim] You’re right. We should’ve realized that you are an equal part of this.
Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call.
[in disbelief] You called Stanley’s wife?
Oh, oh… yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh… oh God.
No, I have to take it, or it’ll seem suspicious.
If you talk to her, you’re gonna tell her about Stanley, and that’s gonna seem more suspicious.
Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won’t talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.
[picking up phone] Hey, what up, Cynthia? [lowers phone, looking terrified]
[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]
[hangs up Michael’s phone, leaves room]
[talking head with Eric and Megan] I learned that a company can describe their internship as “full of exciting experiences,” even if that’s a lie. There’s no regulation.
I learned that half these people’s email password is “password.”
I learned that a ream of paper is 300 sheets.
Oh… I guess I didn’t learn anything.
I learned that if you look even the tiniest bit like Jet Li, Michael will call you “Jet Li” all summer.
Yes, Oscar come on in.  Close the door if you would.  Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.
Yeah, it’s routine.  I’m just a little bit scared.
I’m sure everything will be fine.  [pulls up a chair]  What do you? What’s the procedure, if you don’t mind my asking?
In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? [Oscar looks irritated and frustrated] Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?
My main concern, should I have a safe word?
Yeah.  [Oscar gets up and walks out]
So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?
Abso… you know what? I’ll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.
Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I’m gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you’ll get it Weds.
Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?
Oh right, this thing. I remember now.  [whispers to Jim]  What’s this about?
Ah, this is just me and David, if that’s okay.
It’s okay with me but he’s gonna want me in there.
No, ah it’s okay Michael.  We got it.
Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like I’m gonna blow my brains out.
[nods] Okay. [Jim smiles and waves to Pam]
Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me?  No, because we are the Three Amigos.  And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off… to the bathroom… while the other two have a secret meeting.  [shrugs]
Okay, it’s just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.
Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.
Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you…
Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.
Did I?  Doesn’t sound like me, not very superstitious.
If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  That’s how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk.
Please don’t talk about my breast milk.
I just don’t want you to lie to me.  I don’t want you to ever lie to me.  Have I ever lied to you?
I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, I’m on the ground and the ladder’s on top of me.
And that’s how you broke your ankle?
Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
This doesn’t concern you man, you need to walk away.
Oh really, I’m sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didn’t know we were in communist Sweden.
If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn’t have to worry about this ’cause we’d have universal healthcare.
I will send this off to corporate.  Make sure you hold on to your medical bills.  Feel better.
Thanks T-Man, later.  [fist bumps Toby}
So long Darryl, feel better… [to Toby] He’s lying.
Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don’t just fall off of ladders.
A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house.  It was on the news.
Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  [imitating Darryl]  Y’all having birthday cake?
Please… and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point.  The ladder didn’t reach the top shelf.  I don’t know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel.  [impression] I’ll punch you in da mush, see.
[walks into conference room on his cell phone, interrupting David and Jim] Uh huh, well if he doesn’t like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired.  Sorry, I’m going into a meeting right now.  I will… I love you too.  Bye.
Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don’t mind.
Do not mind!  Yes, I do!  No, I don’t.  Yes, I do!  No, I don’t mind.  Catch you guys on the flippity flop.  Oh this… call waiting.  [answers his phone] Yeah, uh huh,  well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.
[spying on David and Jim] They’ve been in there a while.
No, I think they’re talking about me.
Yeah, that makes way more sense.   Okay thanks boss.
Thank you.  Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you’re not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.
Here’s the deal.  I really want to go but I’m not gonna go if Ryan doesn’t go, because it’s kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I’d really like to be there to support Jim.
[staring into the conference room] How are your sales doin’?
Oh, I’m sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay.   “Hey Andy let’s go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha.”
Shhh, I’m just trying to figure out what’s going on in that room, okay?
Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I’m completely overwhelmed.
You know when they say it’s so crazy it just might work?  Well, I don’t believe that.  I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.  It is just elegant.
Oh, just backing up and turning around.
Dit, dit, dit, dit, it’s not for you. [enters the conference room]  Pardon moi, Messieurs.  I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.
Alright, well I should go.  Thanks for this.  You’ve given me a lot to think about.  Please promise me you won’t do anything until we speak.
No, I won’t.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.
[crawls out of the cheese cart unseen] Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me.  How you doin’?
Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?
[spying at Darryl’s house] Sounds like a EMDP-40.
Nah, that’s a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.
I’m rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
Wow, I’d love to take a look at that.
Yeah, it’s just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
Well, you know, ’cause of  the trains.
Here, get down! He’s not using crutches!  Get the camera!
I can’t believe this. [mistaking Darryl’s sister for Darryl] Hey you, ass****!
You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?
Ooohhh… [crashes car into garbage cans]  Oh man!  You okay?
So, I just wanted to confirm that you’re not coming to my wedding.
Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
Can you just tell me now if you’re coming or not?
Are you sure you’re okay with these new responsibilites?
I’m just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone’s talents.
Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.
What about Jim?  Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?
[looks at Jim]   Permission to speak on the record?
Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it’s his performance report… right here.  Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.
[reading performance report]  “Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is.”
It’s not very well written, but you get the gist.
Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?
I can just continue to run it myself.
Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.
Wow.  Ummm, well I’d have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.
Ummm… okay, here’s the thing though.  The plan doesn’t work unless we have someone to replace you.  I was hoping… plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer.  We may have to replace him.
I didn’t tell Michael because I thought he’d try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.
[after talking to David, Jim looks dejected] I can’t help but feel partially responsible.
[shakes jelly beans] Little pick me up?  [Jim accepts] Oh those are the best.  Little sugar rush.
When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
Well we did talk about how handsome you are.
Why don’t we head in your office to talk?
Oh what a week, God.  We said… I know there were certain things we said…
Michael, look I’ll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
Hmmm, that’s weird, that’s weird… it’s kinda weirding me out.  Did you know that Lincoln’s secretary was named Kennedy.
Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.
I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
I need to see your pupils.   I need to see if they’re dilated.
You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
Are you… are you serious?  Be… cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?
Here’s what I’m gonna do, I’m calling corporate and I’m filing a complaint against both of you.
Hey David, this is Michael Scott.  [Jim pushes speaker phone button]  Michael Scott here.
Just wanted to talk to you about  Jim Halpert.  I understand that he did not receive the promotion.  And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.
So, what, you’re changing your mind about Jim?
Absolutely, [turns speakerphone off] not. [turns speakerphone back on]  Like I said before, Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job.
Michael, it seems like you’re cutting in and out… This is not what you said earlier.
Wha… here’s the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.
Well, it doesn’t change what you showed me in Jim’s file.
Well, nnnn, that… that was an anomaly.  That file had been falsified.  Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.
Michael, I really don’t know what’s going on [police sirens in background] down there, but… oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit.
Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we’re here to apologize ahh…
Wait!  They’re using the lift as their own personal elevator.
He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.
Well, I don’t think there’s any reason to check ’em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain…
Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.
And I’m telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
Phhhht.  No judge is gonna believe that…
Ahhh, kay.  Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our… with our lives.
So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork.  We worked it out.
Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.  Alright,  Just do it.
How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
I never recommended you because I didn’t want to lose you and I didn’t want to lose Pam, [starts to choke up] and now I don’t wanna lose the baby.
Kind of in the middle of something here.
Should I tell him you’ll call him back?
I, yeah… no, I’ll tell him myself.  Let’s both.
Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?
Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please.
Oh, oh, well here he is right now.  [Michael knocks on desk]  Come in.  [Makes sound effects for door opening and footsteps and points to Jim to answer]
Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool.  But it only works if everyone’s on board.
Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.
We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton.  Both of you guys working as co-managers.  Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.
I like that, so manager and co-manager.
Co-manager and Co-manager.  See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.
Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed…
Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make… whoa do you have an announcement?
Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.
Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.
What’s happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome.
[shakes Michael’s hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them]
Niagara Falls in October?  Pfft, hells yeah.
Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
Nah, I’ll just tell you now, easier.
Well, you have to choose a food option and there’s information in there about directions and lodging…
I’ll just have whatever’s fanciest, unless there’s ribs.  I’ll just get the other information the day of, I’ll text you.
You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.
And you will eat whatever is fanciest?
[sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  It’s incredible.
Ah, ah, ah. Where’s the “please”? We’re not animals.
[in Michael’s office] I have a complaint about Jim.
I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.
That is not– okay– that is day-to-day.
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[in Jim’s office] I’d like to lodge a complaint.
I’m sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So… When did this happen?
I’m just gonna write “held back tears.”
Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.
If you stop crying, I’ll stop writing it.
[at the door] Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.
Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I’d like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.
Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?
Look, it doesn’t take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn’t have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
Thank you. I’ve noticed we’ve been having a lot of conference room meetings.
And I’m wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um–
No, I don’t think they are. I think the meetings are very important.
Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.
Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
N– well, to be fair, Jim… James… Jimothy… To be fair, Jimothy, the– ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?
Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn’t about planets…
Because it’s a big universe, and we’re all just little, tiny specks of dust.
I just think that maybe they’re eating large amounts of the day.
You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it’s light out, you wake up, it’s dark. That’s the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.
How about this? I think our goal should be we don’t have meetings unless they’re absolutely essential.
Alright. No more meetings this week.
I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I’m also pregnant.
You know, it’s a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?
We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We’re also accepting other gifts not on the registry… However much.
It’s awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn’t Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?
My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn’t tell you, but you’ll still be suprised when you see it. You’re not registered for a birdhouse, are you?
[walks in, see’s Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.
Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
Stanley, you don’t need to answer that.
“If you don’t smell this, you’re fired.”
Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people’s time with meetings like these.
Michael, this is a conference room meeting.
Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.
Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.
What do you guys think? [all start talking at the same time]
Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
No, no, no, you don’t need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.
That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
That’s exactly what Wallace told us.
I love rivalries– Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It’s so much fun. But I guess if I’m really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I’d have to go with L.C.  Heidi’s a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.
I’m not bossing you around. I’m trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace. [Michael pulls out his cell phone] I will call David Wallace.
David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don’t we just–
Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager.
Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.
Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
David, I know that I’m very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
Wait, I’m sorry. Michael, are you– are you texting me?
I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.
Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?
No, it will not be. I am on top of it.
Talk to you later– [Jim hangs up] Okay, you didn’t let me say good-bye. [sighs, and claps hands once] Alright, I am looking forward to this.
I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don’t see you anymore.
All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.
You know, there’s no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don’t say anything about it.
Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
No, we can do it during the day. It doesn’t have to be that dramatic, Jim.
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
Jim, don’t take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?
I’m sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
Sometimes the smartest people don’t think at all.
Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro– everyone gets a little bit.
[in nerdy voice] Con– you look like a nerd.
Con– no one gets as much as they did last year.
Pro– you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.
Con– you unzip your pants, and you find that there’s a calculator down there.
Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn’t hear where.
I don’t think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
Like money? Like you– you want my money?
Cool. In the memo line, I’m gonna write, “To love’s eternal glory.”
Is this what I’ve become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! “Mrs. Pam Halpert!” That’s the first time I’ve seen it in writing!
You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. ‘Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us…
Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I’m gonna kill myself.
I’m not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!
No, it’s because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
Okay. Well, why don’t you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don’t you enliven me?
I don’t think you’re good at making tough decisions!
At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it’s an unpopular decision.
Okay, here’s a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!
But maybe I’m here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I’ve been sitting out there, and I’ve been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don’t you run yourself out there and tell them? [laughs] You call it.
[leave the conference room to address everyone]
[to the camera] This had better be terrible.
Look, you guys are smart, so I’m just leveling with you. I’m just trying to treat you like adults.
Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we’re smart people.
But, I do not understand. If we’re such smart adults, then why don’t we get raises?
Excellent question, genius. It’s because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
[walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What’s going on?
Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you’re smart?
No! [put’s down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan’s car?!
This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
Okay, Dwight, you know what? You’d be getting the raise so–
What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!
We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
Yes. They don’t get ’em, if we don’t get ’em!
My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn’t get shoes?!
What the hell?! [everyone complaining at Jim]
Wow! I’m just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so… [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]
We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
You’re not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct…
…when he was telling us his dumbass plan.
We would just like to know what’s happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? [all say yes] Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we’re going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.
Again, that gives us no information.
This isn’t a game, you know? It’s our livelihood!
Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.
[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he’s a temp and doesn’t count, so let’s get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]
[everyone talking to the camera] Just–
Yeah, I don’t understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.
It’s not like we’re not gonna see the checks. We’re in accounting!
[out the side of his mouth] And Jim!
[to camera] It’s going really well, actually.
He’s not a part of this. You know that.
Just wanted to draw a picture of him.
Alright! Who to pick? [walking around the table] Who to pick?
Okay, you’re gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in]
Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table]   That’s right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
Hey, what are you guys doing in here?
Why aren’t there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?
Why can’t you? My time is just as valuable as yours.
This is how you make this important decision?
There’s no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. [starts to take Stanley’s beans, Stanley swats Andy’s hand with his crossword puzzle] That is ridiculous. This is how it works. [everyone continues to argue]
It’s not so much that I might not get a raise. It’s just demeaning!
Thank you! That is exactly– by the way, I would also like a raise.
No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.
[leaving his office, hurrying to Jim’s office]
Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I’d say I’m about a four.
Usually a ten, but I’m feeling like a zero.
I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
Um, nothing. I just… I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. [leaves office]
[to camera] Michael’s my only friend left in the office. Except Pam… I think. Is she still upset?
[at Michael return to Jim’s office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!
[Michael give Jim a “World’s Best Boss” mug] Thank you.
[someone knocks] Just pretend we’re not here.
Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
Yeah, I mean, if it’s all the same for you.
Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?
Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift…
Yeah. No, no, I’ll um– the hundred. I’ll just take the hundred.
The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
[writes a check, gives to Ryan] Don’t tell Jim.
Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn’t like she is screwed. It’s amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It’s so bad ass.
Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.
Oh, gee, I’m sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I’m not stopping for anyone.
I don’t think I’m asking for too much. I guess it’s just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
[standing next to a car decorated for leaving a wedding] What do you think? I spent all morning on it.
Yeah, but aren’t you supposed to do that to our… no. It’s great.
It’s just a really important day for me.
Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.
Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don’t column.
So… you’re going to provide them, then?
No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
Come on. You’ve got to be kidding me.
Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
Absolutely. ‘Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
Decent people everywhere will get offended.
Well, we’re thinking of my grandmother who we haven’t told and is very old-fashioned.
Well, you’re lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.
You know, Angela, you don’t have to come to the wedding.
Yes she does. Yes she does. We’re all gonna go and we’re gonna have a good time. [hugs Angela]
Next time we’re all in this room Jim and I will be married.
See you later. [others say good-bye]
And, hey, don’t embarrass me when we go to Niagara.
What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara. [laughter]
Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You stole my joke. Don’t steal my joke.
But you can say that about anything.
What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.
No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that’s my joke.
Pam and Jim’s wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.
I stole the guest list from Jim’s desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.
For instance, Pam’s cousin, Jocelyn Webster.
Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
Well… she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.
Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.
[in Andy’s car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It’s like a five hour drive-ish, you know.
This is so much cooler. We feel like wer’re in a limo and you’re our driver.
Oh no. That wouldn’t be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
Not only is Erin really sweet and cute… she smell’s like my mom.
[in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat.
She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that’s in my brain forever.
We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
[in car, Michael driving] Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.
Alright. We need some tunes, I think.
This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.
Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It’s really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
And Beesly. Tonight we’re in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
Can we take a look at the suite now?
Oh, I’m sorry. Somebody just checked in.
Oh… is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
Oh, no. Just an individual. That man over there.
Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I’ll break in the bed. [laughs]
I’m gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.
Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.
The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
I’m sorry, sir, but I’m not seeing you in here. When did you make your reservation?
I don’t have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.
Oh, ok. Unfortunately, sir, the block only applies to the rate. I’m afraid we’re all sold out.
Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number: Romeo. Tango. G7745.
And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.
I’m staying in your–  Come on, Dwight.
Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.
Oh no. Now that I don’t have a room, can I stay with you?
Um… no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can’t. And I’ll tell you why.
If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she’s going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.
Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! [rips reservation out of Michael’s hand] That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
Ok. ‘Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.’
When Mary was denied a room at the inn… Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we don’t know what happens because that story hasn’t been told yet.
Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?
Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.
Not in the same bed. In the other bed.
A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.
I’m not a physics major, Stanley. I’m just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?
Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.
You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.
Oh, Mema? She’s the one in the teal suit. She’s the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.
Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She’s very conservative. So, mum’s the word.
Who’s doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and–
Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it’s just going to be blood relatives, I think.
[talking quietly, trying not to move his lips]That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
I wasn’t sure about your branch of the family. After I heard about your parent’s divorce. But you and Jim are just perfect. God bless you.
Oh. Thank you… but nobody’s perfect.
Well… I wouldn’t care to live if I thought that.
Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
[laughs] No no. She’s my girlfriend. Hey? Can you make room at the head table?
From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It’s all in the report.
Why would they make the bad man a boss if you’re so much smarter?
Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim… the bad man was busy kissing the boss man’s butt.
That’s right. It is ew. It is very ew.
Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She’s also my maid of honor.
I’m sorry, it’s Kevin. I thought it was Gil?
You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
Oscar, I would be proud to date you.
She has a boyfriend. He’s out of town.
[to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.
More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories.
How did Meredith get put at the young people’s table?
She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
Jim and Pam, I can’t tell you how happy I am to be here.
Isabel Poreba. Oh, I’ve got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?
Alright, so I’ll be like, ‘You’re so sweet guys and so kind’.
Like, ‘What? What?’. And then we’ll just give him a little punch in the back and–
You know what? Never too married for a noogie.
They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me… up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.
Pam, you’ve got the greatest smile and you’re body is really fine.
Hoping it’ll make our wives take it up a notch.
That’s a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.
That’s not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. [no one is laughing]
And… you… everybody can laugh. It doesn’t have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.
Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.
What’s obvious? Why can’t Pam drink?
[clears throat] Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that… they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they’re living together, they’re having lots of consentual sex–
Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can’t expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it’s just a different sensation.
When you c– well? Am I wrong? They say it’s not different, but it’s a different sensation.
When you use something to block– I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It’s not necessarily different for the woman–
…but it’s different for the– ok. Ok.
Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.
That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.
I know. I can’t believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.
Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
I have not found that to be the case.
Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.
Mema’s not coming to the wedding. She’s leaving tomorrow morning.
Oh. You’re that foul guy that kept talking about intercourse.
I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma… and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she’s better than everybody.
I want to go to bed but I can’t. I can’t turn that television off.
Oh. Ok. Well… hook you up, there. [turns off tv]
People are like cats and dogs these days.
This used to be such a great country.
They’re gonna name the baby after you, you know. They’re gonna call it Mema.
Yes, and if it’s a boy they will call it Sylvio.
Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.
That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?
Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. ‘Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!
No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.
If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don’t tell anyone that I said that, ’cause I want them to come.
And where do you think you’re going?
I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
Well, why don’t I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
Mmm-hmm. Ok. I’ll go with you. Come on.
Looks like you’re going to a fish fry, Dwight.
No. They’re howling at the moon. It’s suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.
Ok. [Dwight howls] That’s not appropriate. [Dwight continues howling] Uncool. Uncool, Dwight. [they both howl] Ok. Ok. Come on. Let’s go. [both howl as they exit]
It’s not a good idea. There’s no such thing as a good hairpiece.
Yeah. But that’s easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.
I’m just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It’s not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.
Wait. You’re worried about your horses? That’s cool. How many horses do you have?
[talking to an attractive woman] Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar.
Oh, my God. Twins. I’m sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.
[everyone is dancing] Go Meredith. Nice moves.
You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.
Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo! [Andy does a split and screams out in pain]
It’s gonna be fine. It’s gonna be fine. Pam’s here. [knocks on Pam’s door] Pam? [knocks again]
I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.
I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.
Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.
Everyone else is too drunk.  Just don’t let me die here.
[on the phone] Hey, hey! Where are you?  Can you take Andy to the hospital?
Please stop saying what.  Can you take him?
Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I’m pretty certain I’m completely wasted.
Your brothers took you out drinking?
[over phone]  Is that Pam?  Hey, have her come out!  Have her come out!  It would be like Coyote Ugly.
That’s Michael.  You’re out with Michael?
I love you.  Okay, I gotta–I gotta go!
Mmm!  It’s after midnight. [points at Jim]
You’re married. [hugs Jim] He’s married!
Oh my God.  You’re not going to be able to talk back.
She’ll be sitting home saying, “Jim… take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons.”  [Dwight laughs] “And… and clip my toenails.”
“Jim… hey why don’t you braid my hair.  I want to watch TV.”
Nope.  I, like you, have never been here before.
Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on… my scrotum.
Look, I’m not the one who asked you to do a split when you’ve never done one before.
I was trying to liven things up a little bit.  I was kinda doing your job so–
My job?  My job is to get married in the morning.  That’s my job.
Well it’s also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so–
[Pam swerves the car back and forth] Ow, ow!
[snickers] I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding.  Ah yeah.  She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.
Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?
[folding his pants on top of the ice machine, man walks in with ice bucket] Why don’t you take a picture.  It’ll last longer.  God.  Can’t I get a little privacy?
[Kevin rings bell at the front desk] Good morning.  How can I help you?
I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven’t been returned yet.
You  must be Mr. Malone.  One moment please.
[whispers to manager] Sir.  It’s the man with the shoes.
The bag was opened by our shoe shine and the smell overcame him.  I too smelled them and made the choice that they must be thrown away.  Incinerated actually.
I can offer you a complimentary breakfast.
[walking out of hotel room with a woman] You have everything?
Yeah.  So you sure you don’t want breakfast?  It’s the most important meal of the day.
It really is.  I’m not hungry.  I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.  And besides, I wouldn’t want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding.  She needs you Isabel.
That’s really sweet, Dwight.  So I’ll see you at the wedding?
[passes Isabel] Hey, good morning.  [to Dwight] It’s about damn time.  I haven’t gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.  [walks into hotel room]  Oh my God, Dwight.  This room is a pit.
[lays on bed] Really?  I hadn’t noticed.  Too busy knocking boots.
[watching Dwight eat breakfast] How can you eat like that?
I’m ravenous after a night of love making.  You?
Yeah, I’m hungry, but I’m not going to make a pig out of myself.
She was cute.  You know?  She was hot.  She was very hot.  She made love like a tiger.
Brides side or grooms side?  Or townie?
Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn’t think this is going anywhere.
Wait a second.  You’re not into her?  Are you kidding me?
She’s Pam’s best friend.  You guys could double date.  Swap maybe?
Look.  She’s a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one.  She’s a bumpkin.  Pass.
She’s– okay.  Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist?  You have to take x-rays.  You have to scrape the plaque off of people’s teeth.  You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they’re not scared when the dentist comes in.  It– it–
[stands up and walks away]  I already have my European girlfriend.
If your hat hits me in the face one more time–
That’s funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley’s date]
Oh cause of last night?  No way.  Reports have been exaggerated.  Weddings make me very emotional.  I um–I just have that side to me.
Crotch injuries are the worst.  You don’t need to tell me.
No, it didn’t–nothing got torn off.  Who told you that?
I may have told some people that.  I’m nervous.  I’m about to get married.
If you want to sit on this– [hands Andy her wrap] I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis.  Make it softer.
It was my scrotum.  Um, and it was.  Thank you.
I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.
Is it zipping over your belly? Don’t squish the baby.
everybody see Kristie’s stupid blonde extensions?  It’s like they were made from a plastic broom.
Okay, here I come. [walks out in her wedding dress]
Are you sure?  Remember you don’t have to do this.  You don’t.
Mom, you’re totally projecting.  You’re being a drag.
Hey, I’m going to go outside and talk to Dwight.
Okay great.  [Isabel kisses her cheek] Yeah, I’ll see you in a second.  [pauses] Wait, what? [tries to follow, but veil gets caught on wall and tears] Oh! Oh no!
No.  No, but I’m allowing it.  Just come here.
[talking to a woman] That was an intelligent comment.
Oh.  Fine.  Isabel, [holds out hand] nice to see you.  What do you want?
Um… [shakes head] nothing.  Anymore.
[turns back to other woman] So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene’s and Filene’s basement.
[to Isabel] Hey, hey… He’s not sitting with me either.  Where are you sitting?  You need a seat buddy?
Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid.  Where am I gonna go?
So beautiful. [Pam’s starts to cry.  Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey–
My veil tore.  I knew when we were getting married and I’m five months pregnant that I’m not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels–
[takes her hand] Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you’re so pretty.
And who cares?  It’s a stupid veil, right?
No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and– [Jim cuts off half his tie]
There.  Now we’re even.  [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]
[sighs] Everyone’s driving me crazy.  I know way too much about Andy’s scrotum.  [Jim chuckles] And my mom won’t stop freaking out about my dad’s new girlfriend.  [sighs] This is supposed to be our wedding day.  Why did we invite all these people?
I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldn’t be a good wife.
[to Kevin who is bouncing up and down]  What are you doing?
I’m trying to decide if I have time to pee.
The peeing is fast, Oscar.  It’s getting my tie back on.
[to Pam’s mom] Hey.  Hi.  Do you–would you have a snack in your purse?  You’re a mom.  I just figured you might have–
Oh!  Eww… apricot.  Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or–
Oh, no, no, no.  That’s okay.  I was just–I’ve had a very rough weekend.
I’m sorry. [puts food in his mouth] Ugh.  Apricot.  Made of real apes.
Do you think they canceled the wedding?
Relax.  You’ll get your shot at Jim.  Those two treat the whole office like a 1970’s key party.
I came here hoping to meet somebody.  You know, as you do at weddings.  End up going to sleep by the vending machine.  It was loud, but it was warm.
And… and the love of my life is dating somebody else.
I’m thinking about having my sperm frozen.
Heard you might have a whoopee cushion on you.
Sisters in the can and we totally want to get her when she comes back.
Oh, wow.  That sounds hilarious.  I do actually. [pulls whoopee cushion out of pocket and hands it to them]  There you go.  Use it in good health.
Whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  What is the etiquette on taking the gifts?  Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?
Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?
Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
I’d like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
[looks over and sees hole in his present]  Crap.  [sees turtle on the ground, goes over and picks it up]  Come here you.
Well I guess this weddings not going to happen.  I wonder if this is it for them.  [Jim and Pam walk in laughing]
Where were you guys?  Do you know how long I’ve been waiting here?
Well we are here now, so let’s just–
[walks up] Yes! Yes!  I have so much joy…  in my heart… right now.  How do I look?
[looks at Jim’s cut tie] Wear a tie much?
[music starts playing and people start dancing down the isle] I begged them not to.
I know you specifically put this song on your Do Not Play list.
[smiles] Go ahead.  I think it’s your turn.
Wait, what happened?  You’re okay with this?
Okay then! [takes flower girl to dance down the isle]
Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.
I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we’d need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.
Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake.  But you can’t just go right to the selling, you need “small talk.”  What topics can you use for small talk?
Uh, small things. Peas, ball bearings, dimes…
Yeah! That’s good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let’s do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, “So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?”
Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.
Okay, okay. God. What you people don’t know about business, I could fill a book with.
[into mini recorder] The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I’m not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman…
[Michael walks in office, man waits on couch] Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He’s the person you should talk to.
Oh hi. I’m sorry, just a sec. [whispers] Erin, you’re supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
In your schedule it just says nine til noon is “creative space” and I thought this could be part of that.
Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.
You don’t have anything in the afternoon. It just says “free play.”
Push free play til tomorrow morning. [to Grotti] Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You’re seeing how the sausage gets made.
Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.
As a manager of business, you have a lot of pride.
But you also got a lot of responsibility
None greater perhaps, than your need to be sure, that your small or large business is secure in the event of a covered loss.
There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It’s like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.
Jim’s gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
I think you’re right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
God forbid you…  should have a fire in the warehouse.
Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.
Yeah, and a truck, goes off the side of the road, there’s injury.
You will be hearing from me Mr. Scott.
[Grotti knocks over coat stand grabbing his overcoat] Oh, great.
Would you look at that people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh?
Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.
No Dwight, not everything is a threat.
There is no such things as monsters.
I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.
Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I’m in the mob?
No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.
Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.
All mobsters have a front, sometimes it’s selling insurance, sometimes it’s waste management or sanitation.
For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.
Yeah, buy my insurance or I’ll burn your warehouse down!
He did talk about a fire in the warehouse…  and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.
Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there’s not the usual balance between “sane and others.” Toby has mentally checked out since June. It’s a very dangerous time. The “coalition for reason” is extremely weak.
Oscar says I checked out huh?  Huh. [nods head]
[over chatter] Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down.  Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?
Well first of all, there is no such thing as ‘The Mafia.’
What you have are specific families. What’s the guy’s last name?
It’s, it’s a completely different name!
No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
No I disagree. “R” is among the most menacing of sounds. That’s why they call it “murder.” And not “muck-duck.”
Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
I’m not gonna lock my door.  [door closes. Then clicks locked]
Jim? It’s Oscar. I’m so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
It’s Michael, he thinks he’s being shaken down by the mob. I don’t know how you usually handle this.
Hey Oscar.  It’s Pam. Hey. We’re on our honeymoon.
Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.
You’re right. You’re right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.
Already? This, this guy is persistent!
[reads email] “I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business.”
Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?
Yeah right! You heard him! He’s gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.
[hangs up, rips cord from phone] That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!
He’s right. Cops can’t do anything until a crime has been reported.
Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!
When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back
I was thinking exactly the same thing.
No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give ’em a taste of cat food pretty soon they’ll be back for the whole cat.
The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
I don’t know, I don’t know about that.
Wait let’s hear him out, this is interesting.
Here’s what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can’t be openly violent.
Let him know you’re not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you’re stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
[snaps fingers] I like this plan. I’d like to officially withdraw my plan.
No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.
All right. I will meet with him, but I’m not going alone.
Well you’re gonna have to. [overlaps] Dwight:
[Andy dressed as a mechanic, Cornell hat on] What are you wearing? Who’s Pat?
Well if I’m gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I’m a mechanic with a tire thing.
To change tires, no. But it’s metal, I can hit somebody with it.
[Andy is playing with the tire iron] Take that thing off the table! Please!
Well then I can’t use it. I’m just gonna hide it.
Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
You’ll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.
Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.
This is one of those half booths, can’t-decide-what-it-is type of thing.
Waitress, we’re gonna sit over here.
Hello Mr. Halpert. I’m calling from the identity theft department at Capital One. We’ve detected some unusual activity on your credit card.
First would you mind verifying your home address?
Um, yes. [looks at Jim’s pay stub] Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA
And may I have the last four numbers of your Social Security Number?
Well Mr. Halpert. You’re obviously not in San Juan Puerto Rico.
I’m going to go ahead and put a hold on your card.
No. That…  I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.
Very funny sir. We’ll get a new card out to you right away.
If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. Ah, you seem like a nice guy.
Yeah, I’ll have the linguini, red sauce on the side. If the sauce does not come on the side, I will send it back. I want garlic bread, toasted, not burnt. If it comes burnt, I will send it back.
[with Soprano’s inflection] You know, gabba-gool.
What he’s trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.
I don’t really think that we have that.
Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.
If the salad is on top, I send it back.
Why would you cancel Jim’s credit cards?
I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.
Oh God. I wouldn’t last in jail Oscar. I’m not like you.
Oh you don’t know about jail?  Oh you would love jail.
I don’t think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.
Look closely Michael. I feel there’s a plan here for you.
How about you? Maybe you can use supplemental coverage of some kind. Anybody can get hurt! You always think, it can’t happen to you, and [drops hand loudly on table] Think about it.
[approaches with child] Excuse me. Sorry to bother you. Are you a mechanic?
My battery is dead, I’ve got my kid, can you please help?
No, no no, no. Come on. I’m sorry, we’re having our salad.
Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.
I’m sure he can handle a simple jump-start. Now come on, sit down.
He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
Black goes on the red. With the… If we… Positive… Mo- it being a motor drive, it’s probably down.
You want to do this junior? I didn’t think so. Sorry. It’s kind of a long day at the… mechanic store. [Andy places connections wrong, smoke and explosion set off] Aaaah!  You got a leaky spark tube.
So your car’s totaled. Uh, you’re just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He’s great. But uh, I can’t do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles. [Andy walks away, woman is exasperated]
Now if you could just sign this letter of intent, I’ll bring this back to my boss, and we can get this in motion. [Andy clears throat loudly]  You okay, Pat?
Aren’t you a mechanic? Why wouldn’t you put oil in the car?
It was before, my tech- my technical training.
Look Mike, I don’t know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow?
I don’t understand, why would you buy a policy?
It’s just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
You were man enough to back down Michael, I’m proud of you.
I had to make a snap decision Dwight.
It wasn’t a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.
Do you know what “snap decision” means?
How did you get this number? Michael, we’re on a catamaran.
It wasn’t easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I’m in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.
Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I’m turning to you my friend.
I’m gonna help you through it all right?
All you’re gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and-  it- and then go to–
What? Wait, I didn’t hear a thing you just said.
Just [drops] and then you’ll be saved.
No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!
No, Jim please, repeat what you’re saying! I can’t understand you!
I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don’t call again.
Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can’t afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?
Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?
All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.
We have let Michael down, and it’s 85 percent your fault.
Not on the inside he’s not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.
Yes. He’s got to stand up to this mafia guy.
Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael’s brain?
What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy’s not mafia!
Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?  And that happened.
Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.
No. He’s not. He’s just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don’t understand how this works.
No, Michael. What we’re trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who’s a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy.  His background is perfectly clean.
It’s true, he’s clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn’t on the take. Turns out he’s a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.
But Grotti acts like he’s mafia though.
He’s trying to intimidate you to close sales. He’s just a pushy salesman.
And he made us all look like chumps!
Oh! Great. Michael, I’m finishing up your paperwork right now.
Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?
Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I’m actually kind of PO’d.
I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.
I don’t get it. How was I scaring you?
I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.
And I’m not gonna buy your stupid insurance.
How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?
Look, Michael, when we all calm down here, maybe at some point in the future, you change your mind, why don’t you give me a call?
What a tool. [Dwight and Andy exchange looks] What?
Next time you look in the mirror, you’re gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!
We just told you he wasn’t mafia, so you wouldn’t be scared.
You successfully backed down the mob!
You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!
Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I’m not.
So I looked him in the eye and I said, “Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they’re already dead.” I said something like that.
Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it’s not Stop and Shop, I send it back.
Large. If it’s a medium I send it back. If it’s an extra large I send it back.
Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can’t handle the fact that you’re calling us here!
Okay, that sounds good. Um, I’ll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.
Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
[voice cracks] I’m so happy for you…
Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.
[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.
Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?
Is someone there? I can’t see you because I’m blind.
They’re back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam! [reaching out with hands at chest level]
Oh, I haven’t see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.
Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I’ve been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him. [groans]
Oh, ’cause you spent so much on the wedding.
[behind Pam, acting out blind-guy, groaning]
This conversation has two items on the agenda.
Do we have a conversation scheduled?
Wow, that’s… really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
[duck voice] You’re welcome! [quacks, laughs]
I’m sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
Mallard. Okay, I’ll get out of your hair.
Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.
Awesome! I’ll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.
Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.
[laughs] I think it will too, but I’ll just check with him, though.
Oops, sorry. [slides candy back to Pam] Oops.
Well, that’s great. Congratulations. Who’s the lucky lady?
Pam’s mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?
You did not have sex with Pam’s mom.
And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.
Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.
Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?
Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
I think you’re underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.
Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-
She’s right on my way home from work.
Then take a different way home, man!
I di- alright, I’ll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.
Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?
Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
Pam, we’re all set. [Pam places candy on Erin’s desk] Yum.
Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what’d we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?
You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we?
You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael’s slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]
That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.
Michael, you’re all set at Botticelli’s. I changed the reservation to two people.
Erin, look. [holds up parrot rum bottle]
Wow, Botticelli’s, that sounds like a special occasion.
[laughs] I don’t know. I think Michael has a date.
Uh, I think we should just drop it… ’cause obviously he doesn’t want to talk about it.
I was probably going to break up with her anyway.
Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.
Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.
Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? …Who?
No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!
That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset.
[screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window]
[to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
There’s an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down…
There’s a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down…
I’m sleeping with Pam’s mom. Sometimes, dinner.
…the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down… You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.
[outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He’s my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!
[singsong voice] Who wants a hot chocolate?
[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
You need to be more upset about this. She’s your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.
Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
[holding up a sign that reads, “Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office”]
[in Jim’s office] How may I be of service to you?
I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight’s birthday, what do you think?
[both look at Dwight, Jim waves] This aurea is a joke.
[both look at Dwight who is standing right outside the office] Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.
[Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog… what was that all about?
What were you talking about in there?
Trust me it would only make you mad.  [opera continues, Dwight looks at Jim standing outside his office, waves, Jim waves back]
[in the conference room leading a meeting] Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.
Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?
And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  [everyone claps and makes comments]
Who wants to help the world one step at a time?  [Dwight raises his hand] Alright, good.
Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.  [laughter]
Okay, I’m out of here, [pretends to leave] see you later guys…
Ok, oh no here’s an idea… conservation…
I love it, conservation.  Let’s start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.   [stands up and cheers]  No more meetings!  No more meetings! No more meetings!  No more meetings!  [Stanley cheers her on in the background]
Anybody else?  Who else has an idea?
I have some ideas about conservation…
[Michael leaves to answer his phone] Can you hold down the fort?   [on phone] Hey boo!
Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally…
[on phone] What’s it… why are you crying?
Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder…
[on phone] No, no, no, I’ll talk to her.  I will… No… nobody talks to my baby that way… uh ah… yeah, I’ll let you know how it goes.  Alright, by pickle.
[hangs up phone and walks back into conference room] Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.
I’m sorry, I was told I had the floor.
Nothing… nothing at all… it’s all good!
I’m not apologizing to anyone.  Michael owes me an apology.
For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?
Yes!  That’s what I’m talking about.
Yes!  Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!
You have no sense of boundaries Michael.
Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you’re looking for.
Shut up Oscar.  What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!
I don’t think there’s a whole lot of sleeping going on.
Let’s get back to the matter at hand.
Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody’s mom…
Whoa, that’s my mother you’re talking about…
I don’t like the tone here… this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.
Uhh, huh, ho… oooh my God, you are ridiculous!
Do not talk to me that way!  I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.
You are never going to be my father, you get out!
I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am…
Hey. [walks up to Oscar and hands him a report to sign]
[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how’s your day going?
Pam, just for the record, I think you’re overreacting a little bit, your mom’s old enough to make her own decisions.
Oh, well, thanks Oscar.  I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?
Well, he could still… I’m sorry about that… Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.
[Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?
Well, I think I’d look really hot in one.  Where’d you get your fedora?
I think I’m gonna get the same fedora as you.
[Dwight storms through the break room listening to Kelly and Ryan in his ear piece] Shh!
[Ryan and Kelly talking] …it should go with the persona you already have.
Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.
Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I’m taking that back.
[sighs heavily] I’ll give you five bucks for it.
Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back]
This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
[walks into Toby’s office] Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute?
Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was… uncalled for, I’m sorry.
Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot.  Thank you for saying it.
Yeah, er… pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.
This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation.
Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.
She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.
Yeah… that’s why they pay me the big bucks.  [both laugh]
[hugs Toby, who smiles big] You’re a good, good guy.
You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we’d become friends.
[walks up to Pam’s desk with a binder] Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?
Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that’s happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.
[to Michael] What’s the matter, you can’t fight your own battles?
Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off… you know…
[to Michael] Oh, would that make you feel better?
I don’t… um… I can’t hear your conversation.
You can tell Michael that I’m not leaving.
[gets up and puts a hand on Michael’s shoulder] Buddy, I think that…
Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay… you’re a jackass.  [to Pam]  Hey, hey, you know what?  You’re just as stubborn as your mother, when you don’t wanna do something you just don’t do it.
You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.
Barely, I… I don’t have all the facts.  Frank and Bean…
[Pam storms into break room] Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom?  Is that how we’re gonna get past this?  Cause, I will.
Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.
Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh[beep] about your happiness!  Stop dating my mother!
You know what?  I’m gonna start dating her even harder.
[Pam storms out of the break room] Hey…
I don’t need to be friends with Pam.  I have plenty of female friends.  My mom, Pam’s mom, my aunt… although she just blocked me on IM, what’s her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week.
[walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
Well, I had to, I mean… Kelly was not even…
[speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.
[walks into Jim’s office and takes out ear piece] I’m sorry.
Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
Okay, just to be clear, you’re terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage…
I won’t.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
Punishment fits the crime, I accept.  [shakes Jim’s hand and leaves]
[leaving his office with his rum] Night everyone.  Night Pam, thanks again for the rum.
[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.
[looking out the window at Dwight washing the car]  Awww, he did that for me?
Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
[Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
Well, we went on a Segway tour and we’re awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
[Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh… where’d you get that hat?
Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don’t worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha…  [bumps into something] … ha ha ha.
We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
I am going to scare these kids so bad.
This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don’t believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
Nobody told me what people were, alright? So…  label yourselves or take what you get.
That’s really not the trend in vampires right now.
Here is an old man and a goth dude… and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
I asked for a list. [Dwight rides in on a tricycle, laughing diabolically] …and a clown.
You’re not as scary as Book Face, over there.
Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
Ok, kids. You’ve all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
Yeah! [a chair falls over, Michael is seen hanging from the ceiling with a noose around his neck – the kids scream]
Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?
Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message?
It is the easy way out. You are not alone.
…and then I think I’m going to go to the Garlic Festival.
Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
I can’t believe it’s- I can’t believe it’s yogurt. Uh… it’ll be fun
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they’re expecting the both of you in an hour.
Oh. Actually, it’s just gonna be me.
You should give them a call. Check that out.
Alright. Let’s clear this up. [on phone] Well, there’s actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
Jim’s a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh… why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?
They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
Why don’t they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don’t understand.
I absolutely don’t understand, either.
I don’t want you to feel like I’m baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.
Sure. Michael’s a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That’s what a teacher is, right?
Yeah. I’ve spoken to them on the phone.
Yeah, well… this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?
…and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.
They are into appearance. We are selling success.
That’s sorta secondary. [offers Jim the watch again]
He’s trying to micro-co-manage me… or co-micro… manage… me.
The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
[singing] Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman  Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.
Here it is. [Andy is still singing] Suite 401.
Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling. [sings] Suite 401.
Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.
It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn’t.
I don’t think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.
Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?
I’ll just leave that suit in your office then.
Must be nice to have company on these cold calls.
We’re kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio. [points to Pam’s tummy]
How exciting! Do you guys know the sex yet?
[Andy shakes his head ‘no’] Oh. No, no. [laughing] We’re not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together.
[miffed] Looks like somebody’s got a case of the definitelies.
[Michael is walking around in one of Jim’s suits] Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
Michael, people are asking questions.
Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what’s going on?
Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
Uh… I can’t really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.
Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
Mmm… it’s like Michael said. It was some- something else.
It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump]
No it is- don’t! I’m not gonna bump. I’m not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying. [Stanley laughs]
Truthfully, it wasn’t the way he fell in. It was… how long it took him to get out.
And we’d like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
Well that sounds like a really nice deal.
And I must say, that since we are a family business it is nice to see that you are, too.
Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not.
Nuh. Actually, it’s kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh… a nine.
Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.
Pam’s carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam.  Doesn’t matter what Pam looks like.
You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
No I wasn’t. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.
Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.
Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?
Staples? [Kevin clears his throat] Uh, David Wallace called.
He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn’t mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.
[whispers to Erin] I’m gonna kill you.
A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They’re mocking you with wordplay.
I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story.
And when you fell in, did you flounder?
Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and –
I’m not usually the butt of the joke. I’m usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and he’d have to put on my suit and it’d be too short and he’d look… Damn it! He’d still look good.
Michael, you make fun of us every day.
Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, ‘Stop because I want you to stop’ or STOP as in ‘Stop. You’re making me laugh so hard. What you’re doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!’
I don’t want people making fun of my nose.
No. I haven’t finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That’s it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody’s getting their chance.
I don’t want people making fun of my weight.
Ok. That’s to broad. It’s gotta be something else. How ’bout your stomach? Yeah? [writes Huge Gut] Meredith?
Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don’t sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
I really didn’t want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so… what are you gonna do? [she writes ‘sex with a terrorist’]
That is our sales pitch and we are stickin’ to it.
Well, you two are quite the salesmen and a very cute couple.
Oh- [both look at each other and together say] Thank you.
Some couples don’t seem like a good match. You two do.
Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook-
Right. Sometimes I’ll just dance for hours in the living room-
And a baby on the way? You must be so excited.
In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn’t that fun, honey?
Oh. I know the best teacher. Her name is Miss Janet.
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
So now you’re comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. [everyone shows remorse]
It could’ve died of natural causes. So…
Well, they said you stepped on it’s head. He did not suffer.
Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?
What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
Oh, you’re payin’ way too much for your worms, man. Who’s your worm guy?
Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That’s it.
Thank you. [everyone begins to leave]
Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.
Oh, my gosh. It’s like he’s trying to say, ‘I love you, too, Daddy’. I love you, too. [leans over and kisses Pam’s belly]
Sometimes we’re so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.
I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
No, Jim. You don’t understand. Things like this don’t just die. Kids in high school still call me ‘Ponytail’.
Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
Maybe if you make fun of yourself it’ll all go away.
I want to make fun of you right now.
Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
No. Don’t do that. You’re not. You’re not stupid.
Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much? [everyone starts laughing] Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to.
Michael. You know, when you think about it, it’s not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
Well, you know what? You’re right, Phyllis, but I’ve been there before. I’ve seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That’s the problem.
Michael, please. Stop it now. You’re embarrassing yourself.
[watching Angela eat something] Enjoying your nut?
I’m not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
Hey. Who wants to watch Michael’s pond dive? My roommate’s friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he’s bringing it over.
Mm… I’m, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you’re gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so…
We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I’d say we nailed it.
If I’m being completely honest, I could’ve done without the belly kiss.
You know what? I’m sorry. ‘Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.
Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.
You’re fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?
No. I know I’m gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don’t know. It was fun to role play, right?
I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I’m so sick of being single.
What do you think of Erin? I mean- she’s- I- She’s kinda cool.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We’re not watchin’ this.
That will inevitably lead to mocking. So…
Well, we’ll deal with it as it comes.
No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I’ve done this.
Guys. Michael can’t handle this and as your boss I’m saying we’re not watching it.
No. It’s ok. Watch it. He can’t fire all of you.
Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom!
Oscar, yes. You’re right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
Oh… man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
It’s a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?
I didn’t ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away]
I should’ve grabbed you. I’m sorry. Look, I thought I could’ve done today’s sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.
[as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what’s up lifeguard?
Jim, I think I’m in your way. [leans back – they both exit]
No. He’s a- yeah, he’s alright. Ok. [holds door open as they exit]
You’re welcome. Whoa! [leans back] Almost fell. [they both laugh]
Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?
Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don’t accidentally read them.
How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
No. It was a total waste of time. Um… it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He’s really cool.
He’s, like, the coolest person I’ve ever met.
That’s… right. He’s like Marlon Brando.
Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? ‘Cause he is.
I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.
No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.
Wow. H & H.  You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?
Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
Oh, don’t mention it.  You owe me one.  You all owe me one.
No.  I had a fish stick sandwich.  Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches.  My girlfriend didn’t want hers.  Because I guess I’m the only aphrodisiac she needs.
Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  [holds up tray] Bagel?
Okay. [walks out of Michael’s office] You owe me.
Can’t a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they’ll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?
That’s right.  You’re a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.  I’ll try again.  Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
Michael’s been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I don’t know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he’s planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.
These are amazing.  You took all these?
I’ve always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?
Well here’s what I’ve been doing around here.   It’s for a series on exposure in the workplace.
[walks into the office] Whoohoo! Pammy?
Hey!  [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday.
[comes over to hug them both] My girls.  There they are. [Pam walks away]
Pam, aren’t you going to introduce us to Michael’s girlfriend?
I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
I think everyone has meet Helene.  Shall we?
Wait a minute.  [looks at the bag in Michael’s hand] Is that another birthday present for me cause you already gave me a necklace.
Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head]
He put it around my neck while I was still asleep this morning.  What a nice way to wake up.
Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to– inappropriosity.
Please, Kevin.  You’re fired.  [Kevin looks at Jim; Jim shakes his head]  Sorry, sorry.  Work with a bunch of idiots.  Shall we go?
Yes, let’s go. [looks at Erin and nods]
Oh, wait. Um– Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it’s urgent.
Oh, you guys.  Just one second.  [picks up phone] Oh my gosh!  Are you serious?  Shipping emergency.  I don’t think I can go to lunch.
Oh man, that’s crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
I know.  Isn’t that always how it goes?
Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I’ll talk to them.
It’s my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that’s great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.
Something’s up.  That paper was never supposed to arrive.
So, Pammy– are you still liking sales?
Well, you know– Michael and I were– talking, and maybe if you put a little more face to face time with your clients you could improve your sales.
Just want you to succeed Pammy.  You know what, we shouldn’t even be talking about business today.
Why did I get in the car?  I could of struggled.  I have a whistle in my purse I didn’t even blow it.
Oh, Dwight.  I have a little surprise for you.
Let me guess– you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
I will.  [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight’s face]
You give me a gift– Bam!  Thank you note.  You invite me somewhere– Pow! RSVP.  You do me a favor– Wham!  Favor returned.  Do not test my politeness.
Let me get that door for you–  [runs to open door]
Thank you very much.  Now I’ve got it for you. [holds open door]
Oh… goodness… thanks.  You know, here’s a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.
Yeah, feel free to use that.  Anytime.  Okay.
Hey– oh, hold on a second.  Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.
[straightens Andy’s tie]  And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
Whoa–  thank you very much.  [takes off Dwight’s glasses and blows on them]  Oh boy.
[puts Dwight’s glasses back on Dwight’s face]  You are very welcome.
[pulls out Andy’s chair] Have a seat.  Allow me.
[pulls out Dwight’s chair] Have a seat yourself.
You know what?  I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]
Andy is complicating things.  But I’m not worried.  This will only up my game.
Welcome Scott family.  It’ll be just a moment.
I use to love coming here.  The chicken parm is good.  Big part of my childhood.  Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.
What table should we take?  So many to choose from.
[sees table decorated with a banner and balloons] Oh my God!
What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations.  Oh, wait a second!  You mean this one?  Wow!
Not about taking credit.  Let’s just say we all did it.
Well, it was actually me alone, so– wow look at this place.  Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.
Oh you’ll love it.  You can have my guide books.  I think I’m done with those really long plane rides.
Oh. Thank you.  Thanks for lending me the books.
So, mom… which birthday are we celebrating this year?
49 again? That’s nine years in a row.  This is now our longest family tradition.
Well, as long as you’re running numbers Pam, then help me out with this one.  Let’s see your six months pregnant, but you’ve only been married for 30 days, so what does that add up to?
Oh, burn.  Burn on you… and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]
The only time you should care about a woman’s age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle.  If anything I am robbing the grave.
Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?
Oh, well I like Nana, but I also like the classic Grandma.
Oh, Michael what do you think?  Grandma?
Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?
I am.  I’m definitely going to do it.  I’ve already got the run and the bike thing down.  Just need to learn how to swim.  Come on, you in?
Oh no, I think a triathlon is pretty much something I can rule out.  It just– doesn’t interest me.
So it’s a matter of interest.  Good, okay.  It’s not anything you would have ever done.
Hmm… I might have done it when I was younger, but now there’s just other things I’d rather be doing, instead of running and jumping and swimming–
Well there’s no jumping in a triathlon.
You’re thinking of the broad jump.  Would you try– bungee jumping?
Michael, what are you talking about?
[sighs] Nothing.  Just life– and doing things– before you die. I don’t know.
Do I really want to go snowboarding?  No.  But I would like to if I wanted to.
[singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food]
Yep, yep.  Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.
There is no book.  There’s only a survival guide.
You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.
Okay, well, allow me.  You know what– gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make.  I will make everyone’s tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
Oh, no, no, no. No.  It’s stupid.  You’d hate it.  I hate it.
He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
Gimme.  Look at this wrapping paper.  It’s got the word love on it in every language.
I literally– I put no thought into the wrapping at all.  Might as well of been toilet paper.
[opens present, reads inscription] A scrapbook of our first memories by Michael Gary Scott.  For my girlfriend Helene on your birthday.  [laughs]
Ok, there’s a penny.  What’s that from?
It was from the wishing well at the mall.  You threw it in.  I went back later, waded in and I found it.
It’s not amazing… at all.  It’s sort of weird that I went and did that.  And now your wish won’t come true, so that blows.
[reading]  I can not go to school today said little Peggy Ann McKay…
Um– I have the measles and the mumps, a gash, a rash and purple bumps. And my teachers really mean– Happy Birthday , I love you Helene.
I think it’s wonderful, absolutely wonderful.
Well, that’s because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things.  It’s a generational– sort of gap between us.
[hugging book] God… it’s a scrapbook.
Whoa, whoa Dwight.  I’m going to do this.
Hey, hey, hey–  relax I got it covered.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.   [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door]
Don’t worry about it.  You can just owe me.
And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
Okay, weirdo.  Come on.  It’s time for cake.
Oh, I know.  I love how they use butter cream frosting.
I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible  I need to tell you.  I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.
I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.  And that makes me happy.
Wow.  That just– you’ve really grown.
And I want kids.  And you… unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.
It’s not my decision.  It’s mother nature.  And mother has very strict rules about fer–  [waitress comes over to pour water; long pause] — tility.
I’m 58.  What am I supposed to do now?
[reaching for something on the top shelf]  Ahh.
Stupid things wedged up there.  No one in this office will help me.
What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something?  That is a recipe for a ghost.
Oh yeah, you’re going to owe me big time.
It’s like a little envelope– there you go.
Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha–  [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.
Surprise! [laughs]  It’s from everybody.  $15 value.
May I have a word with you in my office please?
Well, this is a work related matter.
Yes.  Join me please, won’t you? [Pam gets up and follows Michael into his office]  I am going to give you a raise.
Because of all the good work you’ve done.
I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
That’s– no, no– it’s not about numbers, Pam.  It’s about attitude.
I have the worst attitude of any person here.
Yeah, I’ll take it. [turns to leave]
Hey, Pam, Pam– with this raise there are strings attached.  [Pam sighs]  And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
[nervous laughter] Oh– okay , what? I don’t– Are you kidding?
Ye– No.  Alright.  I’ll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just–
No.  I don’t think I can hit you in the office.
So, um… we’ll do it after work.  In the parking lot.  In front of everyone.  I’m going to hit you as hard as I can.
Never.  About what?  A little– what are you talking–
Pam.  She’s going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
No, it’s a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
I’m getting concerned that you don’t seem to understand what’s going to happen.  Do you?
I mean– do you ever wrestle with each other?
And I don’t support her choice to hit you.
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
How much time do you think you’ll need?
No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.
Pam, can I talk to you for a second?
I heard about the hit.  Just– make sure it’s off company property, right?
Okay, I think we should probably be okay.
Okay.  And– the-the power– comes from the back foot.  So its– its all one motion through the– body.  So you stay a little low and there’s a twist.  You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm.  [demonstrates punch] Pow!
[stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait– it’s– you’re saying it comes from the foot.
Hey everybody, he’s not in the men’s room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.
It’s not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?
Why can’t you just agree with me sometimes?
Am I scared of getting hit in the face?  No.  Everyday weirdo’s pay dominatrix’s hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.  I’m scared I’m gonna love it.  [claps hands] Let’s do this.
It’s okay guys… I can handle this.  Everybody can go home.
You’re just a bunch of voyeurs.  Are you eating popcorn?
[goes to punch Michael; he flinches] You have to keep your hands down, Michael.
I know. [sighs] Okay.  Alright.  [Pam goes to punch him again] Oh– God!
Michael, you have to put your hands down.
Okay! [braces himself] Pam, Pam– I’m really sorry.  I’m sorry.
So many things.  I don’t know.  It’s hard to choose.
Okay– just– don’t ever date a member of my family again.
Okay.  I promise.  [Pam starts to walk away] For the record your mom came on to me. [Pam turns around and slaps him; he gasps]
[walks with Michael back into the office; Michael is clutching is face and limping] Wait, why are you limping?
Let’s get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
Ahh… [Dwight is holding a frozen chicken to his face]
Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.
Oh thank you.  Thanks.  I owe you one Dwight.
I’m cashing in the favor.  Fire him.
You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  It’s worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  I’m keeping it.
OK, so there’s no defense for that, good to know.
No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!
No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!
OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.
So let’s just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch]  Block.  Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist]
And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself]  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, you’re not.  Ow!  Oh!
Oh my God, he’s making you look like such a fool.
He really is, but not for long.  [steps on foot]  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  [more screaming] You let go, you let go.  Oh, you’re right, I can’t hold on.
You two are so evenly matched I don’t know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
The important thing to remember Jim… we always have what is called the element of surprise. [hits himself in the groin and moans]
But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.
What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
You’ll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.
This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.
Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal.  I just want to stress that it’s all conjecture.  If there’s any concrete news you will know ASAP.
Your feelings journal?  You told me to put it in the time capsule.
Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.
It’s $1.99 to finish the article.  I wonder what it was going to say? [no one makes a move to pay for the article]
Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer]
I got it, I got it… Oh, Tuna beat me to it.
“It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.”
No, no, that doesn’t make any sense.
Oh lord, we’re all gonna lose our jobs.
Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they’re just restructuring to get out of debt.
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
Oh God.  Well, that’s an interesting theory.
You know what?  You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows.  It doesn’t pay much and you can’t unionize.
I’m sorry, Michael, David’s in a meeting.
Ah, well maybe you should spy on him.  [in Valley Girl voice] Oh my God, wouldn’t that be hilarious! [laughs]
Um, I’ll just have him call you back.
OK, OK.  Good.  I’ll catch you on the flippity flip.  Bye. [hangs up phone]  He’s busy, he’ll call me back when he’s free.
[retching sounds coming from the men’s bathroom, Kevin walks to the door and goes in] Michael, are you OK?  Did you throw up in there?
No, I’m just poopin’.  You know how I be.
[in lunch room with several coworkers]  Guys, what if this is our last day at work?  What if we never see each other ever again?  [Andy scoffs and looks over at Erin, Erin looks sad]
I like Erin. There, I said it.  I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so… it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.
[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing]  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what’s going to happen.
OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.  Anything new on YouTube?  Doesn’t even need to be good.  Oh God, I can’t think, need more Mullins.
Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they’ll follow along.
That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
Alright, let’s conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room]  Here’s the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
Sure I’m a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.
Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
[Michael leaves] He needs me.  Seat saved infinity. [leaves]
[walks back in, on cell phone] What? Oh my God!  [everyone starts asking questions]  There has been a murder.  There’s been a murder in Savannah. [runs back to his office]
[reading the game box cover] Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game.
It is so much fun.  Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it…
Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it’s about murder.
I thought we agreed that we wouldn’t do things like this.
This is ridiculous. [gets up to leave, as does Angela]
There will be food. You leave, you do not get food.
Baby carrots. [Angela sits back down]
Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.
Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie’s brother.
Michael, I don’t like this game.  It’s scary.
Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps.  I’m not comfortable with this. [holds up a head]
Well how do you think I feel?  I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy.  Every night, a different woman.  Being oogled.  Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful.
[looks at Oscar who is using his phone, grabs it] Well, well, well.  What is this contraption, I do declare?
It’s my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
Who’s Michael?  I’m Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.
You don’t have to keep saying “I do declare”.  Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
That is the way Southern people talk.
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
Delta Burke, I do declare.  Now, shall we get to the mystery?
I’ll go.  [stands up, begins speaking with a southern accent]   My name is Deborah U. Tante.   Deb for short.
Bill Bourbon was my uncle.  I would have never hurt him any more than I’d hurt a June bug.
Nice accent.  You sound like Forrest Gump.
Well, you do actually.  You’ve got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin’ out of your mouth.
Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?
You know, I think I’m supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?  [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I’m the butler.  You were listening in on that?  You rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!
No, no, no. Don’t turn this into a political thing.
I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if’n she don’t mind.
I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.
[Creed pulls into the parking lot and goes into the office]  Sorry I’m late, boss.  What’s going on?
[accent] Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.
OK. Hang on just a second.  Let me just settle in and I’ll be right back.
Very good, very good.  Now, no one was there in the wine cellar. [Creed gets in his car and drives away]
[in character] Hey there young lady.
I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.
Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.
It’s not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
[in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.
Well, you know ol’ Nellie’s always up for a romp in the hay.
I’m a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.  Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone.  And she might be a murderer.
I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
[accent] Whoa. What’s this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son?  This here’s Savannah.
No no no no no no no. [accent] I’m going to skip forward to a relevant clue.  Here we go.
Well by now you’ve figured out that ol’ Beatrix Bourbon was the killer.
[accent] Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that’s a misdirection.  We still don’t know who the murderer is.  [everyone leaves] Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here.  I can’t do this myself.  Voodoo Mama Juju… what am I gonna do?
OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
Hey everyone, Kevin’s going to give us his take on the situation.  Let’s listen up.
Alright guys, it’s a work day and you guys work here, so let’s go do some work.
Now, Jim telling us all to work?  I think that is a very good sign.
[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-
[accent] I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y’all skedaddled way too soon.  We need to reopen this case.
No, you’re not reopening the case.  The case is closed.
Frankly, I’m not surprised.  A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.
Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie’s.  It’s funny, the guy’s dead the whole time.
Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?
[accent] Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah.
[accent] Savannah?  That’s a far way from Scranton.
Totally… not. [Erin gets up and walks away]
I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
You’re sure it was water, it couldn’t have been acid?
I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.
Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.
This is not a game, this is my life.  You are out of order, sir.
Or maybe he’s just stuck in character.
Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?
It’s going to be alright. We’re a good company, we’ll figure this out.  We’re not going under.
Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  I’m trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can’t think of one.
[comes into Jim’s office using accent] Deb, what in the world – do you have the vapors?
Can’t wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now.  Come on.  Come on.
I should just go.  [accent]  Where to now Caleb?
Michael, can I… OK, I’m just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.
[laying on the ground] I’m the dead body and these are my brain chunks.
Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
No, you shut up.  They need this game, Jim.  Let us have this stupid little game, alright? [Jim nods]
[accent] Oh, you startled me.  My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest.  What can I do you for?
Wallace is on the phone.  He’s returning your call.
I don’t think so.  I think it’s David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
No, I only answer to Detective Wallace ’cause I got a warm body in the other room.
Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late.  Things are still a bit unclear, we didn’t officially decide anything yet.
But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it’s not good.  We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year.  Insolvent.  So, well… You know what?  I’m sorry, I have to run.  But we will talk soon, OK?
Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you… today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
You know what? I can’t really get my head around anything like that right now, but that’s great.  Keep after it, but I gotta run.
[Jim comes out of the office]  What’s the news?
Well there is some bad news.  [accent] There has been another murder.
There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.  My little heart can barely take it no more.  [regular voice] Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.
[Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other] I didn’t do it!
On the count of three we’re all going to put down our guns.
We’ll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?
Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that – get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.
[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their ‘weapons’ on each other, Jim walks in]  Really?
[accent] It wasn’t me.  I’m not goin’ down for this!
Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]
Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
Happy Earth Day, everyone. I’m Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?
The next year he really stepped things up.
Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing… I can’t remember.
I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
Oh my God, you guys, look. It’s Recyclops.
Recyclops destroys! [starts tearing through the office]
I thought you were killed by Polluticorn.
Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something]
That’s aerosol spray. It’s terrible for the environment.
Humans are terrible for the environment.
The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he’s creating a different world for our child.
A world where you truly can be anything you want.
God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]
[seated] Ok. Ok. How ’bout this? [rises, waves, sits back down]
I want it to be better than ‘Great’, Pam. How ’bout I remain seated… and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing. [demonstrates]
Nope. Then my face is down. They can’t see my face.
And it looks like you’re taking a dump.
[doing an announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael ‘The Machine’ Scott. [Michael waves, twirls and sits down]
[still doing the voice & spinning in his chair] Hate the twirl!
Ok. Obviously I’m not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.
I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It’s not even a twirl, it’s a spin. I might do the spin.
The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there’s no where to get it.
Ok, Oscar, I don’t need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.
It’s not a limo. It’s a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.
[at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There’s a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.
Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they’re in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.
[everyone is rushing down the stairs to see the limo] Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.
What kind of mileage does this baby get?
It’s like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.
Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you’re invited and you’re invited and you’re invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-
The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.
[others  start raising their hands to be picked] Mmm… whoa.
The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that’s what you’d  have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
[in the limo with Dwight, Andy and Oscar] I wish the windows weren’t tinted so people could see us in here.
Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here?
Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That’s bigger than my bed.
[the limo driver raises the divider window] Who’s playing with the button?
Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?
Uh, it doesn’t seem like there’s much of a point if the company’s going under.
But if the company doesn’t go under then we’ll finally have all our contacts in one program.
The company’s probably going under, though.
Maybe we should just wait and find out.
So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?
Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.
Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?
No, no. That’s too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, ‘Well, we’re sort of on thin ice.’ [they all laugh] I won’t say that. I’ll something like that.
Thank you for joining us. Come with me.
Well, thank you and, and please call – continue to call me Mr. Scott.
Ok. If you just want to follow me I’ll take you up to the lounge.
Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So –
[walking past bodyguards at the door] Officers. Thank you.
Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime.
I’m glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we’ll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton.
It’s nice to meet you, too. It’s an honor and a privilege.
Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O’Keefe.
For those of you with questions, please line up behind one of the four microphones that have been placed in the aisles.
I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.
Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.
Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.
Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.
Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the – America’s biggest financial crisis?
You guys ever protect the president?
What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?
Not supposed to talk about it. Nelly Furtado.
Rock and roll. [they walk into convention room and are booed by everyone]
Dunder Mifflin is still a strong company. We are poised to come through this more streamlined and profitable than ever. [boos from the crowd]
[to David] This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
It was fun when we weren’t on the brink of bankruptcy.
[accidentally into his microphone] We’re going bankrupt, you think? [angry jeering from the crowd] They are really angry.
The shareholders need to empower our leadership –
I’m just gonna run to the bathroom. Will you save my place?
Oh, I’m sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?
Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
… and we’re confident. There are many things to be optimistic about in Dunder Mifflin’s future and one of them is here with us today. Michael Scott, Scranton Branch manager.
Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?
Bob took me to Capello’s. We got a little tipsy.
Ok. You shouldn’t be telling me that stuff and also shouldn’t be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
Oh, it’s ok. Michael doesn’t really care about these things.
I care about them and I’m just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What’s so funny? I’m a co-manager.
It’s not like you can fire people or anything.
Well – who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands – including Pam]
Stuff gets around. I don’t participate.
I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]
I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
You should get up and say something. You’ve got to be true to what’s in there. [points to Oscar’s heart] Don’t be a wuss.
[over the crowd booing] Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship.
You’re all corrupt. You should be in jail. [crowd agrees]
Quiet! Quiet, please! Please, quiet! Quiet, please. We want to hear your questions.
Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
I don’t know, man. I just don’t know.
I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
To be honest, I don’t know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.
Well, I can’t really imagine you yelling at anyone.
Oh, well I yell. You’ve heard me yell.
Oh. Ok. I’ve heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, ‘Hey, look. We parked over here!’.
Well, that was apple-picking day and there’s no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.
Ok. We’re gonna take a 15 minute break and then we’re gonna answer more questions.
You haven’t said anything yet and we’re headed for bankruptcy. [crowd agrees]
[playing Tetris on his computer] Here’s the thing. Um, I’ve tried it like five different ways in my head and – Oh, got one. Um, I’m such a perfectionist…
That I’d kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
Simple data entry, though. So there’s really only one way to do it.
Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it’s really gonna help.
Well, I’m glad you’re finally being proactive, Jim.
I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.
What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You’ve dug us quite a hole.
Here’s what we’re gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.
Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.
Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.
No. No. No. No. No. No. Don’t call anybody, Michael.
Please do not text anybody, now, Michael.
It’s done. [Oscar, sitting in the lobby, receives a text]
Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.
I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.
Uh, I’m very sorry… about everything.
[laughs] You’re a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you’re in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office]
[from behind the door] Is there internet?
Tell them what you told me. This is genius.
Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and – this is all –
It’s all good. It’s all good stuff. Lay it on them.
I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.
That wasn’t what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.
I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
O-kay. Oh… hey, hey. [follows Oscar into the hall] What are you doing?
Michael, I didn’t ask to come up here.
You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]
Well, that was a waste of a text. Let’s get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don’t seem to have a plan so I’m thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow.
He’s our best manager? Where’s the off button on this moron?
Uh, I’m not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So… you’re the moron.
[zipping through the hall while texting]
He can take the bus. He’s had his limo ride.
[running out of the building with Oscar, Andy, and Dwight] Oscar! Oscar! Come on!  There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!  Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!
Thank you. Thank you for your suggestions.
Is it serious? [Michael stares]  Wow.  Andy’s a wittle scared.
Okay, right there is the problem.  There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.
I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard]  Can you read that back to me?
Would you rather me say “Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?”
“Crazy diarrhea happening right now?”  Cause things can get real adult real fast.
You are also on record as saying “wittle-ittle,” “footy-wutties,” “nummies,” “jammies,” “make boom-boom,” “widiculous,” and “wode iwand.”
Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes.  Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across?  Well if I do, Andy’s sowwy.
You can’t be a baby in the office.  It makes me look like I hire babies.
Well if I we’re complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.
I don’t-just people.  For the record, I think it’s pretty fantastic.
[Elvis voice] Well, thank you… thank you a lot.  And for what it’s worth I think your baby voice is tops.
Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.
Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.
Wow, what do you put our chances at?
0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!
Don’t worry.  There is a surefire cure.  Employee of the Month.  Every awesome place I’ve worked has had one.
Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.
Frankie’s Dirty Joke of the Day?  There’s a bunch of those.
There’s a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say “Delivered.”  Should I delete all of those?
I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.
That’s why you have a “Sent Mail” folder.
There’s about 30 news alerts for “Nip Slip.”
Oh okay.  I don’t know how those got on there…
What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?
Lurk much?  [Erin leaves] I miss Pam.
Is that what we’re going for now?  “okay?”  We used to go for “pretty good.”
Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.  I’m not in this for the trophies, but…
You’re not in it at all, because you can’t be employee of the month, you’re a manager.
Well, technically, I’m a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.
Jim’s talking to Michael right now.  They totally went for our idea!
My idea.  I just need Andy to think it’s his idea.  So it won’t get traced back to me.  In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace.  He will be fired.
Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?
Oh, did you really look it over?  Felt like maybe you didn’t.
Okay. [picks up and reads sheet]  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?
There you are.  I don’t think we have finished with my Inbox.
[shows newspaper article and reads] “Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders”
No Michael, why would you promise that?
Yeah, okay.  Call the school, cancel.  I can’t go through with this.
We’ve already rescheduled seven times.
Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you’ve done.
Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse it’s going to get.
Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?
I’m not a bad person, I bring good news.  Like when I promised those kids I’d pay for college.  Okay, all right.
Would you come with me?  You know, like old times, instead of… [makes yuck face at Erin]
I can print out a new itinerary with Pam’s name on it.
It’s fine.  Erin, you’re going to go.  And you’re going to make sure Michael tells the truth.
Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?
Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
You’re creeping me out.  I’m gonna go.
I didn’t mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don’t nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.
Let me guess, you think you should get it.
This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
Okay, if it’s all the same to you, I’m just going to take away “Survival Skills” and “Self-defense.”
I’m going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.
Good to see you.  Where’s your saxaphone?
Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.
Everyone’s so excited that you’re here today.
Now, I know you probably want to see everyone, but I was wondering if I could ask you some questions first?
[points to a sign saying The Michael Gary Scott Reading Room] You’re famous.
Oh, you know what?  You know what?  I shouldn’t go in there.  I’m pretty busy, I should just…
[cheering] Mr. Scott!  Mr. Scott!  Mr. Scott!
Mr. Scott, I know you’re a busy man, and your schedule moves around a lot.  But through all your generosity through the years, your tots, who are ready to graduate, thought it was time to give you a proper thank you.
You came into our lives and made a promise, made us honest, made us realize, we don’t need to compromise, cause we can have it all!  Cause you made it possible, for us to achieve the improbable!
Hey, Mr. Scott!  What you gonna do?  What you gonna do, make our dreams come true!
Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-
So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
Five minutes ahead of schedule.  Right on schedule.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you’re all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?
Number nine, number nine.  Jim Halpert.
I… I… I did not… That was not… How come not?
Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could’ve given it to myself because I didn’t even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.
Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I’m not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we’ll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
Yeah, you said “In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.”  Isn’t that what you said?
No, Dwight, I meant… Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-
Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.
Let’s put your hands together and give a warm welcome for the man of the hour, Mr. Michael Scott.
Oh, no.  We’re okay.  It’s a double period
I’m Zion, I’m Mikela’s younger brother.
Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition.  Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody’s tuition.  I’m so, so sorry.
I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry.
Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  They’re lithium.
Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.
Guys, I’m starting to think Pam’s not really even pregnant.
Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn’t Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we’ll move on.
That would be employee number three, which would be… son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.
How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?
There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
No, wait, come on.  I didn’t miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.
Guys, this isn’t some elaborate scam, okay?
Hi, I have an order here for a custom cake, Jim Halpert.
Okay.  That is me, but I didn’t order the cake.
Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim]
[imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?
No, he’s in his weekly staff meeting, can I take a message?
Tell him I’m mad at Jim, because he’s asking us to give money to Pam.
[imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson.  Jim Halpert is a menace.
[imitating Toby] It’s Toby Flenderson.  Listen, things are getting really bad down here.
Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I’m sorry.
Who does something like that?  Who promises that to a bunch of kids and then just doesn’t come through like that?
I can give you an extra laptop battery.  Not everyone took one.  How about this?  If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?
Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?
Really? Wow.  That’s over $200 a year.
Okay. Okay.  Make it out to my mom, Rosa.
Jim, what the hell is happening there?
So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It’s been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife?
I really don’t know how it happened, David.
Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier.  If you can’t do that, we’re going to have a separate discussion.
All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
Uh, hey, I’m sorry.  I’m taking this out on you.
It’s been crazy here.  You know I think you’re doing a great job, right?
Okay.  Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?
Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do—
Please stop.  15 lives.  I destroyed 15 young lives today.
No, there’s financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.
The principal told me that 90% of Scott’s Tots are on track to graduate, and that’s 35% higher than the rest of the school.  So I think if you hadn’t made that promise, a lot of them would’ve dropped out.  Which is something to think about, I think.
What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn’t go out of business?
I’ve always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.
Yeah.  I just sort’ve had a feeling about him.  I have a feeling about you too.
Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.
Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.
What?  Diabolical plan?  I wouldn’t even know how to begin a diabol… [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight’s daibolical plan]
I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
I want the same thing you want.  I want to take Jim Halpert down.  I want in.
But effective, look! [everyone turns to pay attention] On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.
My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I’m just tired. The days are short. I don’t know. Maybe I’m depressed.
Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
No, it’s not “ugh.” It is… office camaraderie.
Why don’t we talk more about it instead of doing it?
Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight! [others join]
Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]
We didn’t, because we think it’d be better to do it together.
Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you’re not covering anything up?
Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die…
We’re supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!
What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin]
I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds? [six geese are inside Erin’s car]
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It’s me, Santa Claus!
So Santa, what can we expect from this party?
It’s going to be a very jolly time if you’ve been good!
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
What if you’ve been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?
Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it’s a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!
Is it funny? I thought it was more …interesting, than funny. [she walks over to see Oscar at the window looking down on man catching a football in parking lot]  I think my water just broke!
Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
Heeeeeere’s Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see. [points to Pam’s’ pregnant tummy]
Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.
Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
It’s insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn’t it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!
I’m not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can’t be Santa.
Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.
[santa voice] Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only … pretending to be a man, I’m the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!
No it’s not, not like penis-wise. [as Santa] Hello little boy, what’s your name?
Michael it’s me, Kevin. Phyllis says I’m too big for her lap.
Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.
Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go. [Kevin sits on his lap. It’s a struggle] Oh my God.
That’s really comfortable. [Michael gasps]
What would you like for Christmas little boy?
I don’t know. I didn’t know you were gonna ask me that.
What did you think was going to happen?
I didn’t know. Nobody’s ever let me sit on their lap before.
All right, just say “some toys” please.
Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don’t want to mess up on this list.
What about if I tell you the things I don’t want?
Okay get off, get off! [pushes Kevin off] Oh! Oh, God!
I didn’t even get to tell you what I wanted!
Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn’t have to go through this again.
You promised me this. Don’t make me get Bob involved!
Never mind, I shouldn’t have said that.
I keep trying to figure out who’s sending me these gifts.
Is it you? [Andy stage face, eyes pop, big mouth smile, Erin laughs]
Yeah! Totally serious! I’m your Secret Santa! Busted!
Uh, Matt is on a delivery. Just leave it here, I’ll take it.
Matt’s a pretty good-looking dude, don’t you think?
I’ll just leave it here with you. [drops checks, leaves. Daryl smirks]
Ahhh… Ho ho ho! [struggles to pull Ryan towards him] Come on I need this. Come over here!
Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!
Can I just talk to you for a second?
You can’t yell out “I need this, I need this” as you pin down an employee on your lap!
Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!
Do you understand, you forced my hand?
Michael, it’s Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
Oh, do we? Do “We?” Is that what “we” want? Why don’t “we” take a vote on it?
Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are–
Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand]
No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we –[Dwight counts the raised hands] Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?
Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand]  Can I get you some punch?
I’ll get some punch. That looks delicious. [shoves Santa hat into punch]
Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.
Well I don’t have all the pieces yet.
Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don’t have a gun.
Not a gun. [crosses gun off his “what could it be” list]
In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let’s put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle’s eye! Let the party begin! [Dwight plugs in tree lights, office applauds.]
Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is.
You can’t, [Michael touches his forehead and makes sizzling noise] Ow. Look, you cannot push religion.
Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you’re saying?
Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!
Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that I’m her Secret Santa?
All right sweetie, I’ll tell her its Michael.
[singing] I saw three ships come sailing in, on Christmas day, on Christmas day…
Is it that obvious?  [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey…
Mmm! Good pate, right? [Matt nods yes] Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?
Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.
Oscar’s pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?
Yes! They’re the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
We don’t have a North Pole branch. Idiot. [grabs package]
[on karaoke microphone] Uh oh, what’s Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?
Yes! [Dwight opens package to reveal another machine part]
Oh yes. It’s space garbage. Dwight’s gonna be able to build himself a friend! [sings] Deck the halls with crappy gifts…
Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You’ve been very good this year –
[on microphone] Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery’s a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What’d you get?
[on microphone] Oh, that’s appropriate. Lot of fire where you’re going. Better get used to it. You’re going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You’re going to Hell Stanley.
And this brings us to you, little one.
[on microphone] I can’t see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don’t make me get up.
[on microphone] That’s fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
[on microphone] What? Was I not supposed to say it? [Jim unplugs mic] What? Turn it back on.
No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office]
David, guess who I’m sitting here dressed as.
I’m not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up.
I’ll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.
I’m Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.
What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?
Do you want me off the call too Michael?
Listen, I shouldn’t tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house.
Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that’s one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.
Are you serious?  This is so offensive.
You know what’s even more offensive, is baling on this party because some…  jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here’s my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.
I don’t want to say. But, “it’s fun to stay at the -” [nods to fill in blank, but Dwight doesn’t know]
[gestures the YMCA dance] Mmm, mm mm mm. [Dwight smirks, leaves]
I, I thought that you would like it.
What were you thinking? [Andy freezes]
I suppose a gentlemen might… throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen.
How could we do what? [general murmur]
It’s not… Nevermind. Nothing. [arguing voices]
David told me on the phone. David told me.
He said, we have been sold. [upset murmurs]
Aaaarrhh!  [kicks over Christmas tree]
Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
David’s gone. Alan’s gone. We’re all gone.
Okay. We haven’t gone under. We’ve been sold and that can mean many different things.
It’s hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not – no offense Meredith.
No, you won’t, because he’s not picking up his phone.
Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.
He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them I’m a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom.
It’s not sweetie, it’s Michael Scott.
David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse.
David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned.
You weren’t supposed to tell anyone Michael.
I am not supposed to… Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don’t know.
How ’bout us? It’s Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman.
Look. They’re buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works.  So congratulations.
Yeah! [office erupts in cheers and applause and hugs] It’s a Christmas miracle!
Woo hoo! [climbs on desk, stage dives into crowd of employees]
[singing] I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don’t know where it goes, but it’s home to me and I walk alone. [Meredith and Madge help right the Christmas tree]
[opens “New Moon” poster] Jim…. Jim! [Hugs him]
[singing] My shadow’s the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart’s the only thing that’s beating…
[opening kite from Ryan] Wow! Cause… [reveals Kite Runner book]
Thanks man! [awkwardly tries to hug Ryan, pats him on the back]
[singing] Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging…
Oh! You got it? What is that? [Dwight building his gift]
Huh. Well, maybe those will help. [puts bag of walnuts on his desk]
Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I’m doing, Pam.
Oh man! [Dwight dropped a walnut into the nutcracker] I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails…
Hi Michael. [Michael sits on her lap] Mm. ‘kay.
I would like an Xbox, and a TV that’s compatible with an Xbox. And, I’m sorry.
An Xbox it is. Because I’ve decided you’re a good boy.
Scott! What in the hell is going on here? [Bob enters dressed as Santa too]
I’m really sorry. It was earlier today.
I’m good baby. [they kiss, both dressed as Santa]
It’s real slippery out here. [sound of drummer’s starts]
Twelve drummers drumming. [marching drum band lines up to perform, Andy steps out with cymbals]
Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys! [dances along to the drumming]
[Dwight using a robotic voice over the PA system] Hello, Eric Ward. Welcome to Dunder Mifflin. I am Computron, your answer to everything.
[entering on a Segway Scooter] I see you’ve met Computron, our virtual helper. I’m Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?
Great news, Michael. We’re now the official paper supplier of the NFL.
That is fantastic. It’s good, but it’s not good enough. Keep working. And here’s Pam. She’s our international sales consultant.
The NFL celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1972.
It might seem crazy, but since there’s no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin’s highest ranking employee. So, that’s where we are.
For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley… although, I get it.
Uh, I just need to check out your warehouse and then talk to your HR guy. That is pretty much the only reason I’m here.
Ok. Well, I thought I’d show you around a little bit –
– since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper’s Seafood. You like lobster? You’ve had lobster before, right?
They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You’ll love it.
No, Computron, actually I think Cooper’s is the best. You’re gonna love it.
It’s called ‘due diligence’. Basically, I confirm inventory, take a head count, see if there are any HR liabilities. I’m a glorified fact checker. Actually, I am a fact checker.
Alright. Excuse me. [slides past Eric to close the door to Ryan’s closet office before Eric can see Ryan in there] If you will –
Michael, do you think I could get a space heater –
– follow me this way. I’ll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two. [Toby’s chair spins around to reveal Dwight filling in for Toby]
Oh, we will. Have a seat. [Michael gives a pleased look then exits]
I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby’s favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time.
So, um, the manager, Michael Scott… is a bit of a character.
He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company’s top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I’m currently wearing is that of gracious host. [laughs] Welcome. [Dwight exits]
Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help?
Um, are there any outstanding liability issues to be aware of?
Well, safety issues, injuries that could leave the company open to potential lawsuits.
Um… nothing comes to mind. [clip montage]
You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy. [shakes head] Keep philosophers busy for awhile.
What about non-safety issues, in terms of liability? Sexual harassment. Anything like that?
I don’t know how I’m going to get through this. I don’t want to lie and I DON’T want to tell the truth.
Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin’? Whatcha guys talkin’ about?
Well, Eric’s just going over some stuff.
HR stuff? [pulls up a chair] HR Pufnstuf. Right up my alley. [pointing to Eric’s notes] What is that? What kind of stuff is that?
It’s uh, it’s a company evaluation form.
Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?
Look, you know, in any company  there’s going to be certain degrees –
No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever. [clip montage]
Is anyone near retirement age? [Michael and Toby look at each other – Creed clip montage]
[on the phone] Hey, uh, yeah, I finally got a chance to sit down with HR. So… well, I think I’m gonna be here for awhile.
This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive. [to Toby] Right? Would you agree with that?
Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.
That’s, that is true. [clip montage]
[as Eric is being escorted out by Michael and Toby] Thank you, so much.
Thank you. It’s nice to meet you all.
I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of… or Pam… or Kevin? [clip montage over Daryl’s Dunder Mifflin jingle]
I don’t care if he goes and files a report and says that we’re nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun.
Computron, I’m gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy?
[after a pause] Please don’t. Computron –
[extended Lazy Scranton video] Sittin’ in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin’.
Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that ’cause of the electricity. The city’s laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you’re bitten by a spider.
But the little cars go in the compact spot!
I think you don’t know what you’re saying.
It’s from “Sob-ray”, our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what’s inside. Scissor me. [Erin tosses Michael open scissors, Pam is appalled]
Here we go. [scans stuffed animal] Oh! Wow.
Cool. What next? [Dwight puts his face on scanner]
Guys, um, who’s Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who’s coming tomorrow?
Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control –
Impulsivity and inattention to detail.
Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened…
And distributed things which should not have been distributed.
Well, maybe we can put the box back together.
Impossible. He opened it like an ape.
[Pam and Oscar are trying to repack cardboard box] Yep, yep.
Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle –
Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?
Have you tried making everything smaller?
Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please. [Erin tosses open scissors across Jim and Pam]
[fumbles] Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.
Alright, he’s on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?
Why do I have to explain everything?
Because we’re usually not on the same page.
Oh. Okay. And to you. [begins applauding]
Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?
You know what, Dwight? Let’s give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?
Um, hi, uh, my name is Gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions.
Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert.
We are very impressed with this branch and we are so excited about this merger.
We’re very excited too, aren’t we guys? Right?
We have a little song prepared for you.
Um, actually, if you don’t mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website. [correctly pronounced “say-ber”]
Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys.
Ok. [playing guitar to the tune of Miley Cyrus’ Party in the USA]
Saber. [sings] Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay.
Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sob-ray. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay. Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sabre. [music stops]
Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.
Oh, you mapquested it. It’s four blocks away.
Well, now we won’t get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
We found a great local daycare. It’s rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it’s also really hard to get into.
Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That’s weird.
We’re hoping our interview seals the deal.
But if not, there’s always the army. The infantry.
You’ll find it easy to embrace the Sabre spirit. Welcome. We’re very excited to go on this journey with you.
[Christian Slater impression] So you’ve been shown a nonsensical video. You’re probably wondering, “What’s going on?” Well, you’re not alone.
Most of our business comes from selling printers. So don’t think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore, but as printer salesmen who also sell paper.
At Sabre, we really encourage honest communication. You should always feel free to express your thoughts, your –
We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks.
I already booked a Great Lakes cruise.
Hey, who the hell’s going through our stuff?
Actually, that’s Nick. He’s your new IT guy. Uh, he’s setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites.  And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well.
Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment.
We’ll still get to use the little cups, though, right?
Little cups? Like paper or plastic or… ?
They’re 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.
Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle.
You know what can’t fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything’s running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.
[in line to fill up water bottle behind Kevin and Toby] Really? You don’t have enough water in there? Your stomach?
Looks like we kicked it. [indicates water jug is empty]
I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.
I don’t want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre’s doing for us.
Oh, I don’t get that sense at all from you, so…
Well, you should have a little. But it’s great that you don’t, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I’m – I’ll be honest, I’m having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of ’em.
Well, I wish that I could do something, but it’s kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know?
So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I’m good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
You know what? Let me see what I can do.
[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I’ve ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
There’s a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here.
Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like, [imitating Italian accent] “Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries.”
I think when Andy finally asks me out he’s going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can’t wait to see what he comes up with.
The ball’s totally in Erin’s court. After the whole drum line thing.
[on videochat]  First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so…
Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have [Michael gesturing behind computer] really been proud of the way… Okay, um…
Wait a minute, who is it? Who’s there? Is there somebody in the room with you? [Michael gesturing “no”] I want to see who it is. Turn me around.
Turn me around. Now. [Michael starts to leave, Jo whistles] Hey, Buddy. Is it something I said?
Hello. No. My name’s Michael Scott. Hello.
Oh, hello, Mr. Scott. Pleased to meet you.
Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.
Aw, thank you. I’ve been working on it since I was a little girl. To, um, to what do I owe the pleasure of this videochat?
Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and –
Pardon. Pardon me, Mr. Scott, but the last time I saw a company as mismanaged as Dunder Mifflin, it was my grandson’s snowball company, so you’ll excuse me if I prefer that you all adapt to the way that we do things.
Ok. I feel very strongly that you can’t just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because… he knows. He’d know what to do.
So listen, why don’t you tell Gabe if by the end of the day you can’t handle the changes.
I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.
I would take until the end of the day if I were you. [Michael leaves conference room]
Good to see you. Come on in. My office is right back here. This is the play room.
This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh –
No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn’t like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn’t focus on anything in particular.
[cell phone rings] Oh. Got to take this. Sorry.
We should just go. He’s really uncomfortable.
He’s uncomfortable because you’re acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
That’s the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
I hope you’re not busy doing something.
No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on.
Fantastic. Teddy, look who just stopped in.
Wow. Oh, yummy. [David spreads marshmallow fluff on bread] You have got the life, my friend.
Can I just stay here and never go back?
I have a doctor’s appointment next Thursday.
Hey, honey. How’s your day going? Did you do anything cool?
Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out.
Oh, ’cause I saw you had shoes on, so I didn’t know if you did anything.
No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael.
Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I’d come by, see…
No problem at all. This is great. So what are you guys up to?
Uh, but maybe, uh – actually, you know, I think maybe we’ll go outside. May -maybe we’ll go outside. [drumming intensifies] Outside.
There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
That seems a bit premature, don’t you think? I don’t even know if I have a space for you yet, and you’re already lining up your holiday plans.
Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we’re kind of planners. But we’re also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
Yeah, if the time comes, we can discuss it.
Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?
Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
And you – you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going?
Maybe, because it doesn’t seem to be going super well.
Well, you didn’t consider the fact that it might not be going super well just because it might not be going super well?
Nope. ‘Cause we’re really nice people but you don’t seem to like us.
I’m being perfectly pleasant. Did you ever consider that you might not be as charming as you think you are?
Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children’s toilet? Why didn’t you just lock the door, man?
It doesn’t lock for the children’s safety.
I don’t know. I mean, what can you do?
I don’t have any ideas for you there.
I want to tell you about a business idea I have.
So the kid’s making the noise to pick it up.
No. No, no, no. That’s the -that’s the vacuum noise.
No, it’s ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he’s gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh… It’s like shop-vac. [sucking noise] Did I say that?
Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?
Hey, you know, if you want, I’m sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again.
There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of ’em.
Well, that’s not the David Wallace that I remember. [reverses out of driveway, Wallace follows him] That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace’s house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.
You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That’s the best thing? Really? Ugh.
Well, I’m not really one for making speeches.
But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.
No. This is my toast.  I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.
Michael, this isn’t a toast. You’re just thinking out loud.
Here’s my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.
Just ’cause you have liquid that doesn’t make it a toast.
Here’s the toast. I’m gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That’s like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn’t it? Okay, anyway, welcome.
[singing] Well, it’s a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You’re going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.
Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we’ll…
Take out my Suck It and we’ll suck it.
Well, we are looking forward to having you, so, let me just pull up your information here…
[looking through Michael’s email] I’m not seeing anything under “confirmation.”
Could it be under “affirmation?” Cause you have thousands of those.
No. [to hotel employee on phone] We’re trying to look it up right now.
You [i]did[/i] get the e-vite to my barbeque!
Uh, sir? A lot of people are trying to get last-minute reservations at hotels here for the Olympics, but we’ve been fully booked for months.
Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I’ve always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.
Uh-huh. Seven nights in our street-view economy single?
Yeah, we changed it since it was a while back. I do apologize.
Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.
There is a cancellation fee for this, sir.
[Jo Bennett enters with two humongous dogs, everyone stands to welcome her except Dwight] Why hello!
This is Michael Scott, co-regional manager of this branch.
Oh, that’s Mrs. Bennett, sweetheart. My husband and I are divorced, but I kept the “Mrs.” just to piss off the new wife. Well, let’s take a gander around this place.
[Jo’s dogs are sniffing at his crotch] These sure are pretty dogs…
You should take that as a compliment!
Do you always stay seated when a lady enters the room?
I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.
Over here is Meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton.
Another couple of heartbreakers. Who is this tall drink of sun tea?
That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.
[gesturing to Michael] I thought this guy was the manager?
Oh, he is. He’s the co-manager, and that’s the other co-manager.
Two guys doing one job? We gotta do something about that!
Got some Valentine’s cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.
[as Andy is passing her a card] No, no!
Valentine’s Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine’s Day card, but I didn’t wanna seem “too eager,” so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.
[throwing a card at Meredith, which skims her throat]:
Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!
Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don’t try to cut my throat.
Jo, I don’t know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.
I’ll take over. Um, what we’re doing here:
And sometimes I can hardly handle that!
This is knucklehead talk. I’m not gonna bite it, you know. You can’t give me gravy and tell me it’s jelly, because gravy ain’t sweet! Is it, Jim?
I think one of you should return to sales, and the other one be manager.
I humbly accept the management position.
I… Why would you just say something like that?
Because, well, Jim. Where I’m from, two types of folk:
Well, I’m gonna let this marinate. So you can go.
[almost running into Erin] Whoa-oh, traffic jam!
[imitating car noises] Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!
Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up!
There’s blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine’s card.
[opening card] Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!
Yeah, well it’s Snoopy and Woodstock.
Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?
Uh, yeah I do remember. [reading card] Aw, they love each other.
Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn’t noticed.
Yeah! It’s Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.
[to Angela, who’s having a hard time deciding on a chair] Just choosing seats, not getting married. Chop, chop little onion!
Now Dunder Mifflin has an arm’s reach in all these small businesses all over the northeast. Now we’re gonna take that arm, and we’re gonna start selling printers.
They’re the easiest-to-use printers on the market.
I think that’s it. So we’re all good! [many employees raise their hands] Thanks ya’ll.
[reading her Valentine’s card from Andy] Oh my God.
I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you’re supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.
So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.
I don’t think I’m gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they’re not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I’m definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can’t keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.
Why, is there an untapped gay market?
Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
…Where did you get that information.
Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.
Son of a bitch. [enters conference room] Pardon me.
Oh, speak of the devil. We were just talking about you. Have a seat!
Now Jim here is thinking about taking himself out of the running for being manager.
Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.
Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can’t take the sales out of salesman.
Well, I think you’re both being a little too modest.
No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.
You know, Michael, you have more experience in sales and management, so I’m gonna defer to your judgment.
I think you [to Michael] will become the salesman, and congratulations! [to Jim] You’re gonna be the new manager of this branch!
Great! That’s great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.
[pointing to the window in Michael’s office] Oh, Michael marked his heights. He’s grown!
[on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He’s been promoted to sole manager. We’ve got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89… 88…
[walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!
Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
I like where you’re going with this. Continue.
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
It’s kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?
We do what they did in Saw! … I mean, we don’t kill him, obviously. I have a mask…
Okay, that’s your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!
Well suggest something else then! Don’t just…
He’s supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
Michael, I’m worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.
Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.
No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.
You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he’s manager.
Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? [Michael’s phone rings] Michael Scott, head of sales.
[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can’t just sit there.
I think he is the key. He’s very trusting, he’s looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
Why don’t you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.
I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
It’s ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say “Who’s hungry?”
Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
It’s a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
For now, I’m just gonna go back to work here…
You know, we really don’t announce out loud our sales that much.
Why not? It’s part of the sales experience.
[reading Andy’s card] You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you’re everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.
Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.
Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.
I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone’s computer passwords.
Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
I think that you should call the cops.
No, the cops called us. So I’m gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert’s computer.
I don’t know what to tell you, man. I’m sorry, I just can’t give out his password like that.
Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]
What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?
No, I’m serious, we don’t have to put up… Is it the dogs?
You know what, we don’t have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.
I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I’m on.
[has two tissues in his nostrils] It’s not cause of the smell. I’m just expecting a nosebleed.
I didn’t see you. And you were there all along. [takes papers out of copy machine] Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.
No it ain’t. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.
I don’t even know what that card said.
Believe me, if I got that card? We’d be in the bathroom doin’ it right… now.
You know, it’s funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I’m out there, and I wish I was in here.
Yeah. Except there’s no grass out there. It’s just a farty dirt patch.
I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.
For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I’m not really sure what we do.
We make a poster that says “Happy Opposite Day!” and she sees it on the way out… Nah, that’s stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.
Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could’ve just gone and talked to her.
That’s it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don’t need so much management?
Michael’s saying he’s better at being manager, and I agree, cause he’s a better people person, weirdly.
And weirdly I’m a good dog person, right guys? [dogs go to him] See? They love me.
Fine. I don’t care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it.
[cell phone rings] Oh, I gotta take this. Yep. Uh, finish walking my dogs for me. And don’t ride ’em. Lotta people try to ride ’em.
[Erin leaves room] Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message:
Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don’t like-like you.
“Please don’t read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog.”
[entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don’t like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?
It’s n– that wasn’t… I like someone else.
Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?
Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
Erin, what about my keyboard? [Erin hits a button on an electronic keyboard, playing a beat] Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?
Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together]
[gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy.
[entering elevator with Ryan] I can’t help but think that something we did made this possible.
Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
Oh temp, I like that. I’m going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?
I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?
Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
Well, I’m sorry that I don’t want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
It is not “farm boy swill,” I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.
I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I’m excited.  Oh, definitely.
No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!
There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.
I need a baby.  I’ll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I’ve been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
I cooked my way through Julia Childs’ cookbook, and now, I’m halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edward’s corn flake chicken.
Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we’ve been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.
Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?
[After Pam has a contraction]  Oh, getting there, huh?
I’m having contractions, but they’re irregular and far apart.  So I’m not really in labor, I’m near labor.
Yeah, we’re slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.
Not to mention the extra night’s sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it’s crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it’s a boy.
I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  She’s contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car…
Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
Michael, you shouldn’t have done that.
Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
You know the baby’s not going to live here, right?
Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
Hmm, that logic’s air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn’t conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don’t want to know.  Tell me later.  Let’s go!  Let’s go!  Hospital!
Okay, okay, we’re not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.
Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
Everything’s fine.  We have plenty of time.
Well, you don’t want to wait too long, Pam.  Otherwise the baby’s going to become a teenager in there and you’ll be up all night, from the rock music.
Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Don’t get revenge on me, nerd.
[as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?
Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don’t work, and you can poop yourself.
[with Angela in the break room]  Bare my child.
I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything…  Very well.  Let’s meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
[after Pam has another contraction]  That’s seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
Hold on, hold on.  It isn’t midnight yet.
No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
I’m going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.
Yeah, no, you really should.  Because if your baby’s born tomorrow, he’s going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks.  My old roommate.
Did you hear that?  Butt-mud Brooks.
Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we’re calling an audible, because that’s her call.  Because she’s the quarterback.  I’m just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that’s a big deal.  While we’re on the subject, why don’t I just run you down to the hospital and we’ll just do a quick check?
Guys.  Word of advice.  Speaking as a former baby.  Don’t get too hung up on baby names.  I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.
I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.
You know, it’s getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day’s not out yet.
No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You can’t tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
[as Andy and Kevin shout “yeah!” in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body’s signals.
Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I don’t think I’m going to make it until midnight if I’m just sitting here thinking about it.
Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Let’s go!
The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam’s mind off of what’s going on inside of her body.
I’m going to go look at the Internet.
[as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That’s a good one.
Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.
Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
Yes, this is the only time I’m ever going to make this request.
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
[ as Pam shakes her head] Nope, nope, I don’t think anybody wants to see that.
I can do the evolution of dance-dance.
[as Pam gives the thumbs up]  That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or…?  Okay.
Nope, actually music would just throw me off.  I need complete silence.  Okay…  [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances]  You’re clapping.  I need complete silence.  Totally threw me off, so I’m going to have to start over.  Evolution of dance-dance.
[reading from a book as Kelly admires]  “You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.”
[naming race horses]  Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Whirlaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox…  And…  I know this.  Uh…  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.
Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
It’s been a long time since we’ve come down here separately.
Now, then.  Let’s get to it, shall we?  Item one:
[as Pam has another contraction]  Where are we?  We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
Okay, you know what?  I’m going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He’d probably know…
Jim, please.  Happy thoughts here.  Happy times.
Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Let’s have happy times.
Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor.  And I’m thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.  Erin, read the first one.
Okay, nobody touch Pam’s nipples.  Think of Pam’s nipples as Toby’s grundle.
Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
Okay, yeah, why don’t you go get it?
Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We’re already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let’s go to the hospital.  Pam, let’s go to the hospital right now.
Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you’re really distracting me from my distractions.
Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
I know, you don’t like to be frazzled.
Oh, and by the way, hate that you’re helping her with this right now.  Totally.
Acceptable names include and are limited to:
Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male.
Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You can’t put that in here.
It’s as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.
[Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.
Hey.  I’m not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you’ll try to drive me to the hospital.
Everything is fine.  You don’t have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  She’s not coming out for a while, okay?
I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldn’t wait…  Oh, God, don’t be mad.
Mad?  How could I be mad?  We’re having a little girl.
Wow, we’re having a little girl.  Oh, man.
Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.
[enters the office and has another contraction]  Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.
Pam, Pam!  Okay, alright, okay, it’s time.  Time to go to the hospital.  Somebody get Jim, please!  Is it midnight yet?
4:35.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didn’t have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Let’s go to the hospital, shall we?
Oh, wow, it’s almost time for ultra feast!  Where’s Kevin?
Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
That’s fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  I’ll get there.  And if I don’t get there, I don’t get there.
Mm-hmm.  Yes, I’m fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it’s still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
Okay, okay, Jim.  I think this feast is over and it’s time to go to the hospital.
Nope.  No, no, that’s better.  That wasn’t even the worst of them.  I’m fine.
Hey, come on.  Let’s go to the hospital.
Pam, Pam, it’s time.  Let’s go to the hospital.
No, it’s passing, it’s fine.  It’s okay.
Come on, Michael says we should go now.
Let’s go, Pam.  Yeah, I think we should head out.
You know what?  Let’s go.  We got to go to the hospital.
Okay, I’m not going.  I’m not…  It’s fine.   [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I’m not going today because I can’t do it, I don’t think I can do it.
If anyone can do this, you can do this.
The best news is, we’re going to have a baby today.
No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
I know, I know, I know.  It went by too soon.
We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn’t do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
We’re okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?
You’re not going to.  You know where you’re going?
Yes, you are.  And you know what you’re going to have?
Yes!  We’re going to the hospital and we’re going to have a baby.
I got it!  I got it!  Everybody it’s go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!
No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
Alright, we’re driving ourselves, actually.
No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive.  I will drive you.  Check!  Got it.
Go bag’s in the car…  Keys, my keys, where’s my keys?
Go bag! Where’s my go bag?  Where’s my go bag?
You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!
Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!
No, no, no.  Dwight, let Jim do that, please.
I didn’t know we had a tape measure.
[as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] “We” don’t.
Okay, I can’t find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found ’em.  They’re here.
[entering the elevator] Here we go!  Here we go!  On our way!
Come on, Stanley!  Okay.  We’re going now!
[as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!
This is where I saw that deer last week.
I love escorting people.  In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.  I got a lot of responses.  Mostly creeps.  Made a few friends.
Alright, here we go!  You’re doing great!  She’ll be here soon.
Okay, just breathe…  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.
Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on.
Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let’s move!  …  What?
Pull over!  [Dwight begins throwing various weapons out of the window]  You’re not allowed to impersonate a police officer!  Don’t make this difficult, Dwight!
Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We’ll be fine.
Jim, I don’t want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
I don’t know!  Let’s go by the house and get it.  It’s only twenty minutes past the hospital!
Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We’re going to the hospital now.
Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.  [as he calls Dwight]  Ready?
Hello, Dwight.  Pam left her iPod at her house.  I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.  We need it yesterday.
Why didn’t you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IM’ing you how bored I was.
Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think it’s on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under…
Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it’s under the…
No, no, don’t, don’t tell me.  Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
Dwight just listen!  It’s underneath…  [Dwight hangs up as the policeman hands him a ticket]
Okay, alright.  [he parks in an ambulance zone]
Dunder-Mifflin.  It’s okay.  [he throws the keys into bushes across the street]  I just did.
Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.
[as Pam screams]  Doing great, push again.
[looking horrified as he walks from the room back into the lobby]  Okay, not yet, not yet.  I’m going to go wash my eyes.
That kid’s going to have a lot of hair.
What?  God damn it.  She was supposed to come out yesterday.
I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born.  This frame set me back fifty five bones.  But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today’s paper.
This is ridiculous.  We just can’t wait here.
I think it’s going to be any minute now.
But you don’t know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
I have an ice cream cake in the car.
Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.
[Pam screams as he approaches the door to their room]  Guys?  Hello?  Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna…
You’re starting, you’re kinda losing them.
Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she’s so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
[smoking a cigar]  Yeah, that’s right.  It’s a baby, see?
Sir!  Sir, you can’t smoke that in here.  Put it, put it out.
Okay.  You can’t smoke anywhere these days.
[with Jim, holding the baby]  She’s incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?
No, let’s let her rest.  I’m sure there’s still twelve on each.
She’s seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee.
Oh, thank God.  I haven’t had caffeine in nine months.
I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
Where’s the baby?  I want to see the baby.  Oh!  Oh, Helene, hi.  Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?  Congratulations on being a grandma.
Hello.  Oh, good for you.  I worry about you.
I’m, uh…  You know I think, uh, I think it’s time for me to go.
Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael.
It’s so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
I’m not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan’s arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he’s single]
I am offering up my services to you all.  You saw what I did with Pam and Jim.  I can help you, too.
Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don’t have any?  [Stanley raises his hand]  Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!
Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, you’re obviously single.
You know it.  I am never getting married.
Torn scrotum.  Still on the mend, so not good timing.
Yes, I’m going to ask out Erin.  I’m just waiting for the stars to align.  Literally.  I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I’d like for the moon to be visible.
Well, when you least expect it, expect it.  I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.  I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.  And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.
Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
We were just kids.  What did we know?
Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?
She can.  But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest.  You’ve been through a lot.
One, and then wrap around.  It’s okay.  Hold that arm down.
I can’t.  She’s too strong.  She’s, careful, though.  You don’t want to break it.
I don’t know.  I just, I can’t tell if she’s getting anything.
Well, you’re pushing the milk out, right?
Wasn’t it…  It’s kinda like a…  Like that.
I think you’re good.  Doing a good job.
Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
I can’t tell if she’s getting anything.  It just doesn’t really feel right.
Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while.  I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later.
Yeah, she’ll be fine.  I can always give her a bottle since we’re in the nursery.
No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.
She’s just, she’s really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.
Well, I’ll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?
Maybe it’ll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
[in Michael’s office]  You wanted to see me?
What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
[as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!
I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
Okay, hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to let the cookies cool before you pop ’em in your mouth.  Why don’t you guys get to know each other?  Maybe have lunch together?
Michael, could I talk to you privately?
I’m so sorry if I gave you the impression I’m into Kevin, but I’m not.  I like Andy.
I’m not so sure.  Kevin has an enormous heart.  Literally, he has an elephant heart.  He had a transplant when he was seventeen.  Had some problems, blah blah blah.
No, Kevin doesn’t have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it won’t kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him…  I bet his heart is enlarged, though.
Just don’t let him sit on you…  I’m kidding.  You’ll have fun.  It’ll be good.  It’ll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.
Hey, guys.  We’re short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy.
Careful…  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
You see that?  I’m pretty sure she’s…  Hi.
So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
Hi.  I’m Clark.  Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant.
Yup.  Really great.  When’s she available?
Actually, uh, I’m the consultant.  Got milk?  Ha ha.  Alright, let’s see what we’re working with.
So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch…
Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I can’t tell if I’m really producing.  I don’t know if she’s getting anything.
Yeah, it’s quite full.  Why don’t you put your hand on top of my hand.
When you’re feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C.  Uh, does that hurt?
Okay, well.  Feel how I’m flicking the nipple?  Like that?
Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh…
And you can just…  The baby should grab on to that.
Okay.  So, I’m just not sure if I’m releasing, though.  I’m not sure if…
It doesn’t…  Why don’t you bring your baby over here…  She’s beautiful.
Well, you’re doing a good job.  Just stay relaxed, and I’ll come back in a bit to check on you.  Okay?
Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?
No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it’d be weird if you did it.
Okay, I’ll just go get the other guy.
[on the phone]  Hey, what’s up, kid?
Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I’ve prepared for you?
Nothing left to do except dot the I’s, the J’s, and the umlauts.  Why don’t you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
[trying to sleep as the baby cries]  Jim, Jim, get her.
Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam]
I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay…  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.
Oh, my God.  I didn’t even have to do the “C thing.”
Kevin.  Erin would like a few words with you.
I have really enjoyed our time together.
I want to continue working on our friendship.
Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
And I hope that I’m your friend…  And, maybe…
Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And I’m surprised that you didn’t question me in the first place.
Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.
Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
This isn’t about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you…  Yes, Andy?
[he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant]  Ow.
Hey.  Pam, she’s gorgeous.  Can I hold her?
Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she’s totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don’t want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety…  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!
Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.
[waking up]  Oh,has she been fussing long?
I was out like a light…  Oh, she’s not hungry…
Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won’t latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di…
Bottles are fine.  A lot of babies grow up using bottles.  So are you excited to bring your baby home?
We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?
Twenty five minutes.  And you’re all set with the car seat?
That bottom part needs to go in the car.
Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes.
Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be…  Can we get a late checkout?  I don’t…  I don’t think she heard me.
[entering the Halpert house]  Hello?  Dwight?  What, what are you doing here?
Isabelle.  Hello…  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so…
All I did was bring macaroni and cheese…  Where’s the fridge?
Oh, it’s…  In the backyard.  I’ll take this.
Oh…  Well, I’ll let you get back to it.
Hey, listen.  I know that I’m an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.
Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too.
Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.
Are you really sure we should be leaving?
But you hear the baby crying, right?
Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around.
Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately.  It’s really important, so I’m going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.
The fax says “Erin, will you have dinner with me?” from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.
It’s busy.  Why don’t I keep trying, and then I’ll give you the confirmation in a bit?
Sorry, that’s unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or you’re fired.
[tearing up]  You can’t talk to me like that.  I didn’t do anything wrong.  I’ve been having a tough day today.
Oh, God, no.  I’m…  Just read the fax.
Oh, my God.  That’s amazing.  Let me just fax this, and I’ll check my planner.
Would you like me to help you up out of the chair?
Yeah, we just got a lot of discharges today.
Okay, alright, thanks…  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay…  Okay, let me…  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go…  Yeah…  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.
Five tickets on the windshield…  Hey.
[smoking a cigar]  There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.  And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today…  I think I’m going to be sick…
And now you, two forms of ID, please…  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature…  What is it?
Alright.  How would you like to celebrate?
Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick…  [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby]  I couldn’t find the iPod…  Give me a couple days.  I’ll be out of your hair.
Because it’s St. Patrick’s Day, people go out in groups.
Well why don’t you invite your friends?
Why are you being so weird about this?
Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick’s Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.
It is St. Patrick’s Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.
Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.
Okay. [Pulls desks apart] Just gotta…
Oh, I love this, so much fun! There’s such team spirit in this room! ‘Morning Darling!
I’m sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands?
It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
[pulls out glass cube with coal.] Is that a lump of coal?
No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.
Err, thank you very much. We, we don’t get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I’m used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you’ve ever tasted.
Well, if you ever get down in my neck of the woods, you got a place to stay.
When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don’t care if you’re a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!
Thanks. It’s actually my sister’s old field hockey skirt.
Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to “How I Met Your Mother” that’s the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.
No. [re-enters bullpen from kitchen.]
Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
[swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?
They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim’s desktop] I can’t believe I’m missing this.
It’s kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she’s very ironic.
Okay. Love you. We’ll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?
Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.
Oh it’s tough being here for a lot of reasons.
I mean, you’re here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
I’ll tell you what happened to me. I didn’t see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.
Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?
Oh, no I’m fine, I just have a little indigestion.
Yes.  [Angela returns to desk and puts embroidered breathing mask on]
I’m a little sick but I don’t want to miss my date with Andy. I’ll get better. Whenever I’m sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
Now, after all the talking I’ve been doing. It’s your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like.
Thank you. You know I get way too many ideas from the top. Now I want to hear your ideas. I mean, did you guys know that Liquid Paper? That wasn’t invented by some fancy engineer. No, that was created by a lowly typist.
Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion – soap.
You know it doesn’t have to be an invention.
In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
I am so proud of Sabre’s “Print In All Colors” initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply. [Kelly applauds]  Daryl?
Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse…
The Sabre shipping method could be more efficient. Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper, but printers and paper ship differently. It’ll be faster to deliver them separately, instead of waiting on everything to come in.
Not at all. There’s a way that it can be scheduled. I sketched this out downstairs.
Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We’re very proud of you. You know what, we’re gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
[Looks over his proposal] I like this Daryl. I like this a lot. Maybe you should be doing your sketching upstairs. Would you like an office up here?
Um. I set my stuff up in there. So…  just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you.
Okay. Any questions? Anything on anybody’s mind? I’m leaving tonight, this is your last chance for a while!
Oh no! Say it’s not so, Jo, we’re gonna miss you, we’re gonna miss you so much!
Yes, well okay. Florida ain’t that far away.
How about July 4th weekend? [Reveals paper ticket]
Oh honey. I’m not home, very often. And uh, me and my relatives, they take up the guesthouse. I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay?
You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and –
All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
Let’s follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn’t like Michael anymore. Hmmm.
[singing] Moving on up, to the East Side, to the deluxe apartment in the sky…
Hello. I want you to stop what you’re doing right now. You are stressed, and I’m taking you to lunch.
No, that’s very generous of you, but I’m all set.
All right. Well if you need me, I’ll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.
How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work?
And I’m actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
[Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
Okay? [Unplugs cord, sings] “The cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-“
[Overlapping] When’s the last time you upgraded your printer?
“- and the man in the moon. When you coming home Dad? I don’t know when-“
“-Dad, you know we’ll have a good time then.”
[Turns off Dwight’s music] Whether it’s this time or next time.
[Vocalizes and continues song] “The cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon”
[Singing, Dwight supplies beats] “Little boy blue and the man in the moon.”
No, we definitely can talk about it in the next–
“But we’ll get together then, we’re gonna have a good time-”
[On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
I am not surprised that Dwight’s using my baby to steal my desk. I’m a little surprised that it’s working.
Oh no honey, if you got a bug, I want you to go on home. I can’t have you getting Callie and Jo Jr. sick. These dogs have got to be in a commercial with Dwight Howard next week.
Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
Yeah, but you sound like death, girl. Now why don’t you go on home and take care of yourself and get in bed. And shred that and have them send me a clean fax, okay?
She should go home. It’s not the end of the world. We’ll go on our date next week. She’s still gonna like me in a week. Right?
I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you. [Turns feint]
Oh! You’re sick! [Andy coughs] Dangit! That’s exactly why I sent that receptionist home.
We don’t need any heroes here honey. It’s time for you to get on home now.
You’ll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on.
A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo’s eye. How’d you make that happen?
Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there.
How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television.
Hey there. So I think I’m done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.
Well there’s chatting time and there’s working time. I’m still on working time.
Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.
Well, if you feel like you’ve done a solid days work…
Well I mean, if you can put your name on this day, and be proud of the amount of work you’ve done, then, by all means, you should toodle on home.
No, no, no. That’s super-clear-ish. [Exits, closes door, takes off coat.] Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don’t have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
How you doing stud? You already there?
Dude, I’ve been here since three! I’ve boot and rallied twice.
Fat and ugly. You might actually have a chance.
Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
Oh here’s what you do. Hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, borrow some balls and come meet me!
Maybe next “queer.” Hey ladies, who wants some bangers and mash?
That’s okay, I’m in my “worky-works.” You look amazing!
Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
All right. [The four of them get out of chairs to run out, Jo exits her office. They retreat.]
Oh, you don’t become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off. [Scoffs] You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both!
Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have…
Hey Jo, it’s Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it’s so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers.
You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I’m just gonna reschedule for next week.
[pops back into Jo’s doorway] Thanks again by the way.
Hey! What are you fellas doing up here?
Oh. Yeah, um, I must have did that when I was in the bathroom.  All right then, uh, let me get to it.
You’re awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
Well, any brother of Erin’s is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard. [They shake hands]
Cold hands. [Takes spot next to Erin on love seat]
Oh yeah, you’re the guest. Take the easy chair, best seat in the house. Plus, you don’t have to sit next to this big dork and her smelly feet.
Hey! My feet aren’t smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! [puts her feet in his face]
So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?
None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
All right. Formative years. [She laughs]
Oh! Sorry! Sorry, sorry. [They retreat. Pan around office still full with staff.]
Yes, I’m anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It’s not to celebrate St Patrick’s Day. It’s so I can protest St. Patrick’s Day.
Overnight all my damn bags home. I’m carrying nothing but my Sable gloves.  I’ve had it with Homeland Security. And I want you to put all those tracking numbers in my Blackberry.
How late do we have to work tonight?
You never know with Jo. Sometimes we’re here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn’t show up for three days.
Why does she do that? Why doesn’t she just tell you what your schedule is?
Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn’t have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I’m young, right?  I will date when I’m dead! [Laughs]
Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would’ve turned thirty. That’s just – that’s just depressing.
There is, as a matter of fact. It’s getting sorta late. It’s 8:30. And it’s St. Patrick’s Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I’m going to dismiss my employees.
I’m thrilled with the work they’ve done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.
Okay. Happy St. Patrick’s Day. [Starts to leave office] And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.
Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
I’m so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.]
Ah. Oh great, now I’m gonna get sick. [They both laugh]
No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. [Meredith joins behind Packer] What the hell is going on back there?
Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.
No, it’s not. They call it Quad-Desk.
That’s ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
Oh my God. We’re going to have to re-name it then aren’t we? [Dwight’s phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim’s Quad-Desk]
Look at him. Look at him – t-shirt, jeans…
[laughs] I am flattered. That’s Johnny Depp.
Oh my God, that’s right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.
[feigning accent] Hey, Jim, Jim – where, where do I find the Black Pearl?
Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.
Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it’s not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you’d seen Roger Clemens?
I had a little better reason to believe that… You’re right. You’re right. Well, you’re not right, because Johnny Depp…
I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
[speaking at a staff meeting] First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don’t have a pet, please don’t feel like –
When are we getting to sales topics?
Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company… are not here yet. But will be.. [muttering, people rise to leave] No, no, meeting’s not over.
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
Well then no Andy Bernard per se. [Andy and others begin exiting the room]
Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.
I would like your undivided attention, please.
You couldn’t handle my undivided attention.
Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it’s kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was:
Listen, Michael – about what happened earlier.
Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?
Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I’ve e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
Honey, if I don’t have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don’t have time to walk over to your desk.
Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It’s a big cheque. [Jim stands in corner, texting]
Stop sexting Pam. I’m trying to congratulate you.
This is actually a big potential sale, so…
You writing your memoirs over there?
That’s good. You know, with the kid.
Okay. Don’t gloat. Here’s the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
Alright, here we go. [taps page] Michael…
[on phone] Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. [motions to Darryl] Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy… [covers phone] I’m making a sale. Sales.
There’s other pencil’s in this office.
Give me that [wrestles with Darryl, Andy falls over chair and to the floor]
Honey and jelly sandwich time. [removes lunch from fridge]
Oh, you got to be kidding me. [holds up squashed sandwich] Look at that. That’s –
You saw who did this and you didn’t stop them?
Didn’t have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
The sales department smashed my sandwich.
Yes. All of ’em. Together. It’s a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
Something came for you, Michael. [hands him a parcel]
Finally, Michael. Hand ’em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It’s your job to give us those leads.
We need those leads, Michael. It’s our job Michael. Michael!
[on phone] Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.
Michael, I don’t want to incentivise murder. But – we’ve tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff –
– of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael.
Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.
Why do you keep repeating – [Michael hangs up]
Hello. May I have everyone’s attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I’m going to give the leads to… King Creed! [hands him a lead]
– and to King Meredith! [hands her a lead]
And to King Angela! [hands her a lead] Because today we are all kings. And queens [pats Oscar’s shoulder].
What the hell do you think you’re doing?
So I’m going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one’s going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
Alright. So why don’t you just give me my share of the leads, and I’ll start making some calls?
Ahh, these aren’t leads. What are they?
Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
I’ll give you the leads. But you know what? It’s going to cost you some clerical work [hands her a mountain of paperwork]
It doesn’t matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you’re done, you can watch me shred them.
I want to watch the Kardashians! I don’t want to watch boring –
No it’s – how would he even know the Kardashians?
It’s about a family. A real-life family.
I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.
Oh my god, I couldn’t envy you more.
Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] – that’s just unfair.
How about this one – ‘When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.’
He means his mopey place, it’s under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.
Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment. [cuts to Jim fishing one of the leads out of a catering size tin of Ravioli] A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally [clue next to Jim reads:
Hey. I guess you probably won’t give me your leads since I’m a jerk salesman.
Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads.
[mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]
What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]
Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] ‘The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.’
The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.
[holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.
Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
Well, bigshot, ‘If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes’.
Kevin! Damnit [runs over to Kevin’s desk] Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C’mon –
[begins to strangle him] Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
Turn the trash [releases him – Kevin coughs] It’s code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.
[stands up and reaches for her buttons] Okey-dokey.
No, dear god, no, it’s in the trash can. In the kitchen.
[dashes to kitchen, overturns the trash can, tastes the bin liner] Clean sack.
I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby’s baba ganoush.
If we don’t patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there’ll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.
[dives into dumpster, rattling noises then he emerges] It’s empty!
Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday.
Oh my god. Oh my god [takes off running] oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey [chases after garbage van] wait, wait!
Okay. You know what, let’s just go to the dump, start looking – Ryan, c’mon, shotgun in my car –
Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, ‘Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they’re now in the city dump.”
Well, that’s not the way it’s going t sound. Here’s what we’re going to do. We’ll go to the dump, we’ll look around, then we’ll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you –
Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?
I’m not going. You did this, not us.
Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit [looks to Jim for vocab-reassurance] Complicit. You were all successories!
That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
Okay fine, I get it. I’ll just go by myself.
I’ll go, Michael. You’ll just screw it up.
[looks around dump] This place has gone to hell.
You know, Dwight, there was a time when you’d be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.
Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don’t believe me, look in my gutters.
[to Oscar] You’re adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I’m going to be, like, mad at you if you don’t –
Phew! Can’t wait for this day to be over.
Between the – us and you guys. It’s unnecessary, right?
Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
I mean, if the salesmen weren’t acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn’t be so bad – did you ever think of that?
Don’t use your cute baby to make us like you.
She’s wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]
If we act nice now, then we’re rewarding them for treating us poorly.
I think you’re remembering that wrong?
I don’t know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company’s changed, and if they don’t like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
All those who agree, say aye [all present – Stanley, Andy and Phyllis –  raise their hands] All those opposed –
[kicking through rubbish at the dump] You’ve changed, man.
Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.
Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
No, I’m talking about your personality, Dwight.
When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I’d assistant managed him –
Oh, that’s low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you – you, going nowhere.
You think you would have done better without me? Really?
I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend – I shouldn’t have been hanging out watching karate movies with you –
You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies –
Nice babies you’re making with the floozies at the bars.
That’s my wife you’re talking about, man.
Your made-up wife? Who doesn’t exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!
If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
Don’t do it [lobs something at Michael]
No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. [they throw volleys of rubbish at each other] No, time out, time out. [Michael inspects a box, then hurls it at Dwight] Time in!
No! [lunges for a large wooden spool]
Don’t even think about that [Dwight begins rolling it towards Michael, as he reaches him Dwight kicks it and falls backward. The spool comes to a halt in front of Michael, and Michael pushes it towards Dwight.]
[kicks spool] Stop it, get out! That’s my spool.
What’s the least we can do to make this okay?
I’ll text Pam. She’s really good at this stuff.
And I’ll text Erin. She’s really good at this stuff too.
I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
Oh, if they don’t have an iPod by now they really don’t want one.
Alright. Then we’re back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I’m for it.
Erin just texted me back. ‘People love shells from far-away beaches”.
Okay, Dwight. Here we go [picks up a sink, spills dump juice on his pants] oh god.
Oh [half-heartedly throws something]
We’re never going to find those leads, are we? [they both sit on the edge of a claw-footed bathtub]
[surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them] Wow. Amazing, isn’t it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you –
No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!
[stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
No, no – this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is:
Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.
Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So…  [Jim gestures for her to continue]
Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
Do you have any pastries without fruit?
[enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our –
– two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
Our treats, Stanley, they’ve accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
[beams] This is – nice! [pats Oscar’s shoulder] All of us back together.
This [picks up racquet] Why would somebody throw that out?
Hey [holds up an old sweater] You know who’d like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
Yeah, she does – she loves purple. [Dwight sniffs it] Does it stink?
Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That’s it. And the caption would read:
[drives into office parking lot, honking horn. Enormous purple object strapped to the roof of their car] Woo hoo!
We have an awesome bean bag chair that’s perfect for the break room. [reaches out the window and pats it]
Yuck. I’m not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
Yeah, damn right you’re not. ‘Cause it’s for me and Michael only [they both cheer and high-five]
[strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy’s back]
Oh wow, thank you. You’re the nicest person I’ve ever met. [Andy and Erin kiss]
Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.
My respect. [everyone returns to work] Okay, I’ll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups –
Gets to go home. [everyone starts to do push-ups] Ooh! I say ‘dance,’ they say ‘how high?’ Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. [steps on Angela] Disqualified!
What do we got? Creed, disqualified.
19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.
[Stanley straining and breathing heavily] Oh, wow, that is adorable!
[chanting] Stan-ley! Stan-ley! Stan-ley…
Alright, alright. [chanting continues]
Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
Well, it’s not exactly fair. He’s got all of his weight that’s helping him go down.
One more, one more! [cheers and applause]
Well… Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
I don’t know. I’m free. If you hear of anything going on, let me know.
Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
You know what we haven’t done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included.
Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I’d like to try. I’ll ask Bob.
Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats ’em up. What?
A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.
I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam’s at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
Absolutely, I will do that right now.
I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I – and I love her. I also love her, very much.
So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
[on phone] Yes! Yes! I would love to!
[through phone] It’s been so long since I’ve been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley’s going to be there. Yes, oh my God!
Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto. [whispering] Are you going later?
Talk to me that way again, and I’ll cut your face off.
We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um…  but we’re kinda keeping it quiet for now ’cause it’s still kind of a new thing. It’s a little delicate, and we just don’t want all the drama.
Yeah, cause when everyone knows- [knock on window, open blinds to Kevin giggling and making sexual gestures] That’s actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.
A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?
Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time.
They’re both single, I have a sense they might-
Waaah! [starts to make crying baby noises]
When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what’s fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know… that would be funny.
Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God! [laughs]
It’s not a birthday, it’s not a good-bye party…
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for? [Julie laughs]
Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.
No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.
Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.
Um, I’m gonna do a lap. See if I know anyone.
And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn’t Isabel.
What’s a girl like you doing in a place like this?
A girl like me is why a guy like you comes to a place like this.
Usually means there’s a battle scene coming.
See, I didn’t think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?
I was a little nervous when Pam told me he was her boss, but he doesn’t act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, we’d never get anything done.
[removing tie] Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything. [puts on backwards golf cap]
My brother, good head, bad heart. Good head, bad heart.
Hey, Michael, where have you been? [Michael shoots pool ball up into their faces]
Hey, you’re supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
Guys, come on, I’m on a date. Let me do my thang.
Hi, I’m date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning? [tries to wink]
Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam’s chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!
Guys, one second. [on dance videogame]
We’re focusing, we’re focusing, we can’t talk.
Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it’s all yours now.
If we save ’em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
I know, but you wanted the big thing.
Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?
They’d be like, ‘what’s up with those two?’
‘Did we miss the wedding?’ Um, I got it-I’ll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we’ll switch.
Oh, air hockey, basketball, we could play that. Oh, whack-a-mole.
Two are in the Marines, one’s a cop.
Universal donor. [startled by Angela, curses]
Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
Hey, guys, guys, guys. [steals a cherry from waitress passing buy] Watch this. Ready?
I’m tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
[choking] Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.
I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.
This is exactly what I don’t want, the drama. I don’t want the drama!
[Isabel and Dwight playing whack-a-mole] You are amazing at this. How did you get so good?
Whacking moles. Hit ’em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
Look, I’ve been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don’t need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
It’s just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You’re off the hook.
Dissolved. Don’t worry, you’re free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
[Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he’s not normally like this.
Maybe it should come from a note… with flowers…tomorrow.
You wanna pay 400 bucks to re-felt this table?
Yeah, why don’t you send the bill to 23 I Don’t Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?
Hey, Michael, why don’t you just get down.
Hey, she can tell I’m on a date, right? Right? I’m just having fun.
Really? You told on me. That’s lame.
Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I’m just kidding around. I’m sorry.
Ok, um, why don’t we just finish the game? Michael, it’s your shot.
You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?
Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and I’m gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize.
Then I am sorry that I didn’t kick you out.
I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.
Well, uh, I’m the manager here, sir.
Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don’t see that from you.
Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.
If you’re really interested, it’s called ‘Somehow I Manage’ and there’s going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.
Huh. Have you read Lee Iacocca’s? It’s a classic.
Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it.
Dude, tonight! You’re not going to want to put it down. It’s gonna make you want to go out and buy a Chrysler tomorrow.
We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead.
[Andy sits at table with another woman] Hi.
Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people.
[Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
[Andy spits out his drink] What are you doing?
We didn’t say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!
Get in here. [Andy and Erin go into photo booth] Where did you learn to talk like that?
I manage a paper company-Dunder Mifflin/Sabre.
I did. I actually put it in your bowl.
Whoa, a lot of Stanley Hudson’s in here.
I’m sorry, he’s not usually like that.
Hey, Julie! You having fun? [Julie leaves]
So… when are you coming in for that free lunch? You’re gonna want to come in on a day that I’m working. Uh, maybe I can hear more about that book, too.
Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude’s life story? It’s amazing, right?
I couldn’t understand a word he said.
Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt’s an okay dude, but he’s a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
Maybe you’re right. I should count myself lucky.
This is not what I want my relationship to look like. [holding photo strip of he and Erin fighting]
[over PA] Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I’ve been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you.
You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go.
I know, I do, right? I’m a total drama queen.
Well, I think that he could counter that move. The Scranton strangler is a professional strangler.
Oh, please. I wish he’d come after me.  I would be like-aaah!
Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute.
You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
No, no, no. [trying to talk over her] Blah blah blah blah!
For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
You’re really putting me in an awkward position here.
Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
Whack! [Isabel smacks Angela on forehead]
You’ll see me in small claims court!
[crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn’t give me a refill.
Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady.
I think I did. But I can’t take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me.
Thank you. It didn’t even take that long.
[Kevin’s voice] What’s the difference between a chimichanga, [Kevin arrives behind the group] a chalupa, and a tostada? Call me back ASAP. It’s urgent.
This isn’t funny. I don’t talk like that. [all continue laughing]
Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.
It’s Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
[gets up and starts to walk to Oscar’s desk] Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
[Kevin’s voice] This is Kevin. This is Kevin.
That is an amusing link. I’d like it sent to me, please.
If it wasn’t for secretaries, I wouldn’t have a stepmom.
It’s my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?… It rocked. It rocked my ass off.
[at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn’t have watered it?
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.
[arrives at Michael’s office and sits] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary’s Day.
I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there’s only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary’s Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. [Michael glances over at Erin in reception, Erin waves her teddy bear’s arm at Michael].
[slams his hand on Michael’s desk] That’s my girlfriend you’re talking about.
Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I’ll take her to lunch.
[taping desk] She’s gonna be so psyched.
[walks over to Erin’s desk] Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary’s Day.
Well, happy Boss’s day. There wouldn’t be a secretary if there was no boss.
I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to…[Erin snaps a picture of Michael] lunch.
I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth’s.
Well, Hayworth’s is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I’m…
Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth’s, but…
Okay, well, we’ll figure something. [Michael turns and starts back toward his office]
[looks at Andy who is urging he agree with her, Michael turns around] Okay, let’s go to Hayworth’s.
[sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev.
Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I’m not falling for that.
I brought those in. It’s my birthday.  That’s some stone-cold narcissism right there.
Man, Darryl, I’m sorry. [pats Darryl’s back] Happy Birthday.
Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it]
[as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
They’re making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they’re making fun of me.
[again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M’s? The level…
Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
It’s awful. [reaches for tissue box, hands it to Kevin]
[on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]
Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It’s come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around.
And that’s straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that’s all. Ciao.
[in his car with Erin driving to lunch] Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I’m kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.
I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
[shakes head, annoyed] I don’t know.
Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
I’ve been trying. I’ve been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.
How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
He’s the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
Well, let’s see. Um… Andy. Plays the banjo.
Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don’t think he is a snappy dresser.
I don’t think he is the best dresser.  Reminds me of Easter.
Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
I don’t know. Probably didn’t want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.
They were engaged, so… [Erin looks shocked] Okay, you know what, sir?
Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?
Of course. I’ll get you a bowl of pickles.
[face looks disgusted, moves around uncomfortably] Uh-oh…
What are you doing? What are you doing?
In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming]
Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody’s looking at you right now.
[turns to other restaurant patrons] I’ll have what she’s having!
[in Michael’s car] Did you have a… did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.
[feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
Her milk is coming in. She’s getting uncomfortable.
Same thing happens with my cows if I don’t tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they’ll moo like crazy.
That’s weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?
[removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?
Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!
Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?
Well, I know. [stammers] Just want… I mean… [chuckles]
Erin? I think we’re out of fax cover sheets.
God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It’s easy.
[using a Cookie Monster voice] “My name is Kevin, I’m an accountant.” See I did the voice.
Uh, it’s not organic. Do you know what I mean?
Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. “Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.”
Guys, why don’t we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?
“Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn’t been on in many cookies.”
Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.
You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela’s not so great, so..
I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.
[throws a piece of cake at Andy’s face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
I don’t want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn’t know?
Who are you?! I don’t know you! [pushes someone away to leave]
I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue.
Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would’ve told you.
So if you need anything, I’m right over there.
[imitating Cookie Monster] “Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.”
Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I’m sorry, Pam, but that’s it. I’m going to have to suspend you without pay for two days.
I think you need to go a little easy. You can’t just suspend someone form work.
Yeah, you’re right. You know what? Um, you’re suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.
Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary’s Day?
I was going to tell her, just on my own time.
You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can’t and won’t keep a secret.
Who cares? I mean it’s not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it… I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.
You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It’s the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
I want to throw up just thinking about it.
You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
[standing behind Erin] I don’t think this fax is going through. Is there a different… I can just put it through again, you know.
Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
No, no it wasn’t Andy. It wasn’t. It doesn’t matter. It’s not about who you’ve been with. It’s about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn’t know what it wants until it finds what it wants.
I hope you find what you’re looking for.
Thank you. [kisses Jim on the cheek]
[talking on the phone] So I can reprimand them but I can’t suspend them. Oh I can’t do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.
I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can’t dock your pay. That’s not legal.
Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure…
I don’t think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
[gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it’s done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.
[gets on one knee] I kneel before you.
Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.
Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
[following Jim and Pam to their car] Guys, to err is human. [trying to block their car]
Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What’s your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
Will you stop walking for one second? That’s it. There’s no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.
A year? You were together for a year?
Yeah but that’s it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else…
I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
[walking back into the office] That was ugly. I’m sorry you had to see that.
It’s tacky to discuss finances. It’s best to pretend that this never happened.
Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] “Or cookies.”
What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
[imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I’m now going to apologize for the mess that we’re in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I’m one of the gang.
“I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.”
“Ciao” Right? “Ciao. I say Ciao because I’m fancy from Tallahassee.”
Why don’t we say ciao to the impressions? [everyone says ciao]
Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?
Oh. Yep. I’m sorry about that. I feel… I’m sorry I caused that thing.
Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him:
Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary’s Day.
Hey Kevin it’s Oscar. I’m looking at the sheet you sent me. And I can’t seem to find the column for shipping cost.
I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It’s awesome.
Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
[walking up] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? “Oscar. I am the Count.” Nailed him. Nailed him. [Gives Kevin a fist pump] Good work Cookie Monster.
No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for… for all of North America. And… I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.
Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
I don’t understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
Michael’s having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um… [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
[clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!
Damn it. [knock on door] Ah, Angelo.
Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela’s forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
All right, so I’ll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
You know, maybe there’s an opportunity for a joke there, like, um… like, [vaudeville delivery] “I just delivered a baby. They didn’t offer me a guarantee.”
Yeah, or maybe we don’t even need that.
Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we’re gonna work really well together.
Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.
[whispering] I don’t even know who you are anymore.
Hi, uh, Donna Newton, here to see Michael Scott.
Did somebody order a hooker over here?
There’s this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter’s and, right now, we’re in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so…
Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.
Oh, no we’re actually married. We’re not brother and sister.
You have some ancestors in common… somewhere back.
I knew it. You should see their baby.
[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it’s a tradeoff.
Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria’s Secret?
Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.
You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities.
Oh, this is “Print in All Colors,” Sabre’s minority executive training program.
It doesn’t just sound a’ight, it sounds amazing.
Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
Those don’t really count. We’re thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.
Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he’s Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?
I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I’ll be sitting in Michael’s chair. Wouldn’t that be something?
One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm… the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
[on phone] This is the second time that you’ve sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I’ve been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
Well, they say it’s because of texting, but maybe you’re right.
I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
Never thought of myself as an executive before.
I know, ’cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO’s can you think of?
I can’t think of any CEO’s, any race.
You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.
And that would be a display [image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up] of the crisp, gorgeous black.
It’s subtle. That’s how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn’t know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she’s turned on.
This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I’ve never taken anybody there before.
Oh. [Michael quickly advances PowerPoint show to last slide which is “SEX” in bold white letters on a black background and then exits the show quickly]
And that’s it. That’s me. That’s who I am.
Oh, thanks. [softly] You’re not bad, either.
Thank you. [Michael tries t kiss Donna, Donna clears throat] Hmm.
Oh my God. [realizing Jim and Pam are looking through the conference room windows]
Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
[in his office] You didn’t see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?
Well, maybe you shouldn’t try to kiss people at work.
Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.
Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn’t still be here.
Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20’s it would have been annoying. In my late 20’s, I find it really flattering.
Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.
What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
Pam, you know he’s not gonna get anywhere, and he’s gonna blow our sale.
Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It’s not that huge a sale.
Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
Don’t act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat’s Jim’s arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]
How as being a minority affected you?
Well, there’s a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
Oh, good, and you resent this because…
Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It’s so dorky.
Oh, no, no. That’s not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it’s easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler’s in the house. Inside the house.
[indistinct chatter inside conference room]
[looking it] Look at that. She’s totally flirting with him.
You don’t know that. Some people can’t help oozing sexuality.
You ever notice you can ooze two things:
She just crossed her arms together… that’s bad.
Maybe she’s just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]
Is this… is this the best you can do right there?
Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don’t have a lot of flexibility.
Oh. Well, I guess I’m just used to the restaurant business, [removes sweater revealing her revealing top] where, if you’re in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like.
So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
I don’t see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost…
Okay, well sometimes… sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.
Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
What if she’s just flirting with you to get a better price?
Yeah, Michael, here’s a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says “no,” then she is not interested.
You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
’cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
[typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I’m trying to make her anorexic.
Tell her everyone in home room thinks she’s fat.
You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
It’s easy… you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you’re treated differently because of your race?
Would you ask that same question if I was white? We’re so in.
When I become executive, I’m gonna make Ryan manager.
And then the two of us are cleanin’ house.
Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you’d have told me this morning that today I’d be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I ‘d have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller…
Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?
I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
It’s like cool… “certified cool.” I like how they say “certified.” Like there’s some consortium of… [Michael grabs the mint from Donna’s hand with his mouth, Donna pulls her hand away] Michael!
I can’t stop myself from kissing her.
Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M’s all day.
Well, why don’t you just move the M&M’s?
Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it’s not totally insane to try one more time.
Michael, he’s right. You are turning into a stalker.
Um… I think it’s really, really unlikely.
Really unlikely. But I can’t say that it’s impossible.
I’m not saying she’s in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.
No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just… thank you for talking. Wish me luck.
You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well… anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You’re welcome, America.
Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He’s gone.
I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
Yeah, unless somebody else applies today.
Oh, dear God. Okay. Don’t make any decisions just yet. Okay? I’ll be right back.
That’s very nice. [referring to Kelly’s bindi] I never noticed that before.
Yeah. I don’t want to be offensive but, uh… may I ask you what that means?
We should have your contract done by Thursday.
Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then.
And, um… you know I just wanted to say it was really… really nice to do business with you.
Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
Yeah? Do you need validation? We don’t… we don’t validate.
You’re welcome. [they hug] You’re… welcome.
[follows her out of office] Ahem. So, um… okay, if you have… if there’s any other questions that you have…
I don’t have, uh, any other questions. [blind clanking as she leans against door to prevent from Michael kissing her] I’m just gonna… make my way down to…
Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]
How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
I know. I meant I’d be happy for them.
What I’m offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
Dwight, I know these programs. “Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.”
I’ll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
Speaking of rainbows, Oscar… you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We’re not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen]
For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program “print in all colors” initiative.
Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]
Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I’ll translate.
Well, uh… why don’t you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide.
In Japan, heart surgeon, number one. Steady hand.
Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?
I don’t know. I don’t know. Can’t really trust my feelings anymore.
You know what, Michael? For what it’s worth… I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.
Michael, you know, it’s easy to get fooled. Bob’s warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It… it’s mostly harmless. Usually I don’t let it go too far.
Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
Yeah. This could be a signal. People don’t just take barrettes off.
It’s not a signal. It’s just a coincidence. No, it’s not even a coincidence. It’s just something that happened.
She doesn’t want you to return the barrette. She’s not interested in you.
I know. You’re right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. [waves, returns to his office, clears throat, turns around and runs out of office]
[still in parking lot sitting in her car] Michael!
Oh. You’re still here. I have your baguette.
Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. [clapping] All right.
They’re going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She’ll be the first. The program’s mostly black. It’s almost too black. That didn’t sound right.
[puts a bindi on Erin’s forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I’m not gonna need anymore.
Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]
I’ll never forget everything that you’ve done for me.
Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
You know what? Everybody told me that you weren’t interested. Everybody. And I didn’t believe ’em. And they were right. So… there’s your barrette.
You were right. [Michael leans into Donna’s car to kiss her and they kiss passionately] I’m sorry.
Kelly got into the minority training program.
Really?! Oh, that’s great. That’s such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed.
No, I’m serious. It… this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was… I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki… We did. Okay. We did. We did.
You know what? It doesn’t matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!
You’re talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke’s on you ’cause I know Morse Code. Ha!
It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, “I will when you lose the baby weight.”
Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]
Let me get back to my desk right now.
Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.
Yeah, well, Stanley doesn’t help with anything. Come on. Shout ’em out, shout ’em out.
You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang’s.
Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang’s when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, “I wanna go to Mount Pocono,” you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.
Wait, that’s crazy far. Are you sure she’s not cheating?
You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World:
Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It’s in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
You guys think Donna’s cheating on me?
You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place…
That is right. Don’t make any more of it.
You could start by concluding this meeting.
All right.  [all stand up to leave] And she won’t say, “I love you.”
Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
That seems… quick. Even for lesbians.
Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she…
Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
Amok. It means, don’t let your imagination run out of control.
Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
Well, that’s easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It’s stupid. I live in a fantasy world.
Yes, Jim, I do. And I can’t stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
But you didn’t believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that’s what’s killing me.
[whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
I think I’ve got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]
This is you. How much do you charge?
I’ll give you $50. Money’s no object.
I’m just gonna warn you… and I say this to all my clients… you might not like what I find.
And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]
Of course. Yeah, that’s terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.
My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It’s really important.
There’s no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?
Yeah, I don’t know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.
That’s weird. I haven’t heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.
I don’t know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That’s what I’ll do today. All right. Yeah.
[puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.
You didn’t feel like he was hiding something?
Like he was… covering something up? Maybe.
[sitting on his Firebird’s hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.
All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.
That’s interesting. Wow, it’s a little early for ice cream, don’t you think?
It’s never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn’t have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
It’s comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God.
You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just… stop beating yourself up.
I know. Well, I hope you’re right. We’ll see what Dwight says.
Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
Because I have him investigating her. I’m waiting for a text update.
No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.
It’s too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
Michael. Okay, I’m… I’m going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you’re in.
That’s not true. [Pam stares him down] You’re right, I ruin everything. And I’ve known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.
My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.
You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.
[at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna’s attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.
It’s all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]
Yeah, I’m good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
[chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you’re talking about.
Tractor pulling. Too bad there’s not a tractor here.
Really? Hey, um… [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his “workout”]
Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?
Donna. Donna, wait, please. I’m sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I’m here:
You stay away from me, or I’m calling security.
Donna, come… Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his “workout” and cannot chase Donna]
Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
Yeah, no. She’s not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]
I’m positive. Yeah, oh, and here’s your expense receipts right there.
Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.
Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she’s coming over here and she’s furious.
I am not paying for that membership.
[sitting on the floor behind Erin’s desk, sighs] Ohhh… mmm…
Maybe you’d be more comfortable in your own office.
No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?
Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.
Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I’ll talk to you later.
How could you think I would cheat on you?
I didn’t. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
Ye… pfff. Well, no. It’s a lie. That’s not what happened. I just like you. I can’t believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.
When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak. [Dwight is gulping some sort of power shake]
If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.
Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]
Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would…
Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?
I don’t have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It’s like jazz. [scatting] Andy don’t mess with me. [continues scatting] I’ll figure something out.
Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
It was kind of mumbled, I don’t know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was “Andy,” “Problem,” “Eliminate,” something. I don’t know what it meant.
What? You don’t know what it meant? How about “Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?”
Whoa. I hadn’t even thought of that.
[chuckles nervously] Yeah. Hah. Hoo.
Claire’s? Zales? Ricky’s? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there.
Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor’s Place?
Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn’t Michael.
Wait, so are you… you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
Psst… [Creed walks by Andy and draws his right index finger across his neck, further scaring Andy, Andy looks over at Darryl who is staring him down]
Creed’s head of quality assurance. So he’d definitely be wrapped up in this.
So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. [draws finger across neck] Darnell’s a chump. I would have done it for anything. I’ve done a lot more for a lot less.
Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That’s exciting.
I’m sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.
I lied it’s personal. It’s about me and Jim. We’re… I just… you’re the only person I can talk to.
And they are having problems, so sh…
No, not… we’re not… we’re not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love…
Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.
Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?
[loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!
I love [leans over Michael’s desk to look at his computer screen]… this idea is neat. I’ve never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out]
Yeah I think it’ll be a nice trip. We’re gonna get a lot done.
[to Michael] You’re gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at… golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?
I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. [Pam and Donna both laugh] Hey, you okay? [to Michael, walking away disappointedly]
Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?
Absolutely. [both leave Michael’s office]
Look, I’m not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]
I might have to go public here, but no one’s gonna believe me. Uh… I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.
Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?
God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
I’m gonna kill him. No, I’m not. I feel… I… no, I’m not going to kill him.
You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
I need to have her tell me herself. Right?
I need to say, “What the hell is that? What the hell is that?”
Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
[in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael
You know what? We should really do something fun this week.
Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do?
I can’t do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
Oh, really? ’cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It’d be a great, great concert.
Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.
You’re cheating. You’re cheating on me.
Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna; Jim, Dwight, and Pam are visible on conference room window, they all scramble as soon as Donna and Michael look up, Pam throwing herself on the floor]
[in old Michael Scott Paper Company’s “office”] We’re printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy’s demonstration]
You haven’t even introduced yourself.
Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you’re watching this, it’s because I’ve turned State’s witness because I’m in danger because I know too much.
You should talk in a higher voice ’cause the camera makes you sound weird.
Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention…
Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]
[high-pitched] I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation…
One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]
[higher] May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger… [printer starts smoking and explodes] ah! [speaking lower] It’s working. [in normal voice] It’s… I knew it!
We are blowin’ the roof off! Blowin’ the roof off! [Darryl discharges fire extinguisher onto printer] Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He’s been my partner through this entire thing.
I don’t wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It’s not funny. I’m just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
The other man. Who’s the guy? Who is it?
[on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let’s take this next hill.
Excuse me. Yeah, I’d appreciate it if you’d just let me run this.
You know what? You had your chance. You’re no leader. Out of your seat, let’s blast!
Don’t listen to him, we’re approaching a cooldown down a gentle hill.
No! The hill’s a trap. Let’s take the dirt road off to the side.
No, guys, no. We’re just cooling down…
If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one… jump! No! [points to those around him] You’re dead, you’re dead, you’re dead. Good jump. You’re barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.
Come on, Michael. You’re interrupting.
You’re kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
You know what? We’re not gonna die of radon, we’re gonna die of boredom.
Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.
All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden…
How about make-believe land has anything you want?
Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there’s no evidence?
Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.
Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here’s how you do it:
Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left]
Ready, one bullet. And boom! [makes shooting noises and mimics a bullet with his fingers tapping Phyllis’ throat, then Toby’s, and finally Andy’s]
It’s so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
[reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
Do you want me to go back to the store?
No, no, no, it’s fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open ’em up.
This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we’re just trying to get out in front of this.
After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That’s what Pam told me.
[yawns] Yeah, or no… well… I don’t know. I’m sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I’d be running this.
That’s okay. You probably shouldn’t keep a baby up that late, though.
We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get’s like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don’t know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.
Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
Oh, thank you. It’s reversible, I think. [everyone laughs]
That’s awesome. You want some ice cream?
Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles’ flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That’s my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?
Okay. Well… that’s random. I will dig into those later.
I don’t follow this exactly. Uh, “The Descendants of any replicants from this union shall have…”
Are we talking about your grandchildren?
Rather than spend all day in court, we’ve decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
Alleged? I’m going to own your farm by the time this is over.
Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don’t even need to make contact. The law will do it.
So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point “B”, uh… the beet juice cleanse?
I’m doing it. You know I am. It’s disgusting.
How do we know this? I’d like to see a stool sample.
Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
No secret crying. Hasn’t even opened the tissue box in there.
So we’re gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.
Then let’s just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
Okay, well, I’ll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
[shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
Okay, Pam… she’s not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
Since when is this an office where we delve into each other’s personal lives?
I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband… or you took a random poll, yeah, it’s wrong.
Well, I think we all know what you’re capable of Meredith.
Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
I ask… everyone in the room, “Are you in a relationship?”.
People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.
Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
I’m sorry, it… why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat…
On her diet! He’s a sports guy. He’s scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
So you’re just making a giant assumption. You don’t even know the guy.
You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I’ve lived the part. And let me tell you, I’d so much rather play the part on stage.
So… here’s the thing about infidelity.
Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.
Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he’s an angel? I don’t think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You’re Ali Larter, I’m Beyonce.
This guy’s a high school baseball coach, right? Let’s go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.
Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let’s go check it out.
Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.
Let’s go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can’t wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he’s making me do to her.
[humming Call to Post] Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That’s him. That’s him.
Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?
[announcer’s voice] And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.
All right. Can you just– can you just act normal for a second, please?
Can you two please join me in my office? Now.
You were supposed to be the Lookout.
Yeah, well it’s really warm in here. It’s like a sleeping bag.
I don’t wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.
Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.
Well, you were surprisingly restrained.
Okay. That’s great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.
Finally there’s a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man, a la Benjamin Button.
Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix–
Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor.
Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract.
Look, I can’t enforce that anybody have a child with anyone else.
So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000.
I don’t have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don’t want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
You have no idea what you’re talking about.
And it’s–there’s– well, home plate is like a wicket.
Seems pretty well liked by the team.
Okay, well, that’s because he’s paying their salary.
You do know that high school coaches don’t pay their players.
I know, I know, I know. It–I’m–it– that was a euphemism.
$30,000? There’s gotta be another way.
He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
“Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?”
Look, I don’t think that’s actually legal.
Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
Look, I can’t legally watch this unfold. It’s coming a little dangerously close to prostitution.
Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
I’m not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]
You guys are awesome! Best game I’ve ever seen in my life.
Yeah, right. You must be rootin’ for the other guys.
Are you somebody’s… parents? Oh, are you guys… Kenny’s dads?
Ha. No. No. But we’re gay for baseball. [chuckles]
But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.
Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.
I mean, isn’t marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let’s round you out as a person.
Hey, I’m really sorry, I’m just trying to… focus here on the game.
I get it, man. I love it. That’s what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.
Of course. Okay? I gotta… get back to this.
But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!
Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.
It’s all right. It’s all right. Keep it going.
Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart’s still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, “I’m sleeping with your wife.” And you know who does that? James freakin’ Bond.
Don’t thank me. Thank Dylan’s mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
Why would you throw something wet at me?
Uh, no, they didn’t say team. They just said coal Hawks.
I don’t think those were yours to take.
Well, then it wouldn’t be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.
I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.
You talked to the man whose wife you’re having an affair with.
I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I’m hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.
Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
I don’t know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
‘Cause it’s next to they baby section, okay?
All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, “I read a book about anthropology.”
I don’t really know why you’re screaming at me right now.
That’s Meredith’s cake. It’s her birthday.
I don’t care. I have an appetite for life! [eats cake] Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That’s Lemon.
You know what? I think you’re attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
It’s hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don’t know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can’t be that cold.
[Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we’re out of paper.
[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
[shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
Well, it doesn’t mean I can’t drink it.
Probably shouldn’t tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so… we have a place.
A restful location. Talk to Glen. He’ll take you up in the lift.
Lightbulb’s burnt out, so it’s dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I’m trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn’t exist, okay?
For your signature. [drops document on Michael’s desk]
Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we’re into isn’t very condo-appropriate.
Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody’s spoken their mind, and no one’s changing their mind.
Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.
Do you want someone to stop you? ‘Cause no one’s going to.
Nobody better try to stop me. Good. [leaves the office. door closes]
Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse]
God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]
What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]
Oh, it’ll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It’s not in the contract.
Do you wanna make a comment on the rumors?
[sighs] Umm… I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to… the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
I’m talking about the Sabre printers that catch on fire.
Oh. Okay. I was talking about… what do– what? What’s going on?
OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!
Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.
Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.
Yes. Come on! Get it up! That’s what… let’s do it!
Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It’s on the same site!
Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It’s not even that interesting a baby otter, it can’t even stand up. [looks toward computer] It’s trying to stand up… [choking up] there it goes.
Howdy. I hope I’m not interrupting anything.
‘Course you all, no doubt, know why I’m here.
Turns out our printers are famous. They’re all over the news. It’s an interesting story. Cheap foreign printers attacking innocent Americans. Well, actually the, the real story isn’t quite as racy, but uh… let’s give it a go.
Jo, I think that I know what happened.
Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.
Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.
[quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
If you say anything, so help me God, I’ll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets.
[as Gabe hands out forms to everyone] It’s a little form, says “I did not do it.”
There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like…
All that’s just birthday information, Michael.
Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
Why don’t you come with me? We’ll start out with the honcho, what’cha say?
When Mama was working as a prison guard and something went missing, she’d ask one question:
So say we catch this whistleblower, what do you think I should do with him?
We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.
Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.
Well, I guess we’re all right, Michael.
I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I’d prefer it if they died, ’cause it’s not right.
Mind if I get in there for a second?
Just one… [Dwight pushes Nick’s neck to the desk and pushes his arm up] Gah! Ah! Dwight, what the hell?
Apache persuasion hold, that’s the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
You’re with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
Wait, are they searching all our computers?
Yeah. [Kevin runs to his desk] I already got to yours, Kevin. [Kevin runs back]
No, that’s cool. Sometimes… sometimes I run. I’m a runner.
Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
Ridiculous, Angela. And like I’m going to believe one of his spermed lovers.
Look, he’s been complaining about this for a while, it’s not crazy.
Hold that thought. I don’t want to waste your time, and I wouldn’t dare waste mine. I didn’t do it. Now, I don’t know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here… [hands Jo a piece of paper] You should fire the following people.
Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
Yeah, I noticed you’ve had a great year. Good boy… you turning that money into more money?
I don’t like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain’t investing in property, then you’re dumber than a dummy.
Well, buy property. That’s my advice.
Is there something that you would like to say to me?
I swear on the graves of my parents who aren’t even dead yet.
That’s a little much. All right, all right, all right.
I don’t care, that’s how much I swear!
I don’t know who’s giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.
Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
I think she could… sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she… she’s the copy editor at the Trib.
I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he’s probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don’t know what is.
Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was.
And we didn’t find anything on your computer.
Except this. [hands stack of paper to Toby]
Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I’ve been working on.
I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I’m just curious, why would a man who hates people want to have a relationship with a maid?
The way I look at it, there’s only one of two reasons. He knows a secret about her that she doesn’t know herself, or he wants to use her services to mop up after a murder.
Okay. I’m talking to this woman at daycare…
She’s telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!
So now everyone hates Andy, and it’s this whole mess, and I don’t know what to do.
Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.
I could tell Jo… or I could tell Michael.
This is a very good idea. This is good. Let’s get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
I don’t know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or – I don’t want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!
I don’t know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god… my mind is going a mile an hour.
Two whistleblowers… two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.
[Michael knocks on Pam’s desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you’re saying to me.
So see you in Meredith’s van in five minutes.
Yeah, you didn’t need to actually say it.
[in Meredith’s van] I have never seen so many parking tickets.
No, you know what’s messed up? This situation all up in here is what’s messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.
[opening door] Hey guys, sorry I’m late.
It’s okay, she’s cool, she also whistle-blew.
Guys, I couldn’t help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it’s as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
Hey, hey, it’s as interesting as a morgue.
Of course I’m the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can’t control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof…
[on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
Okay, here’s what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.
Wouldn’t we get fired for smashing all the computers?
No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
Michael, you know you don’t have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
Uh, if you turn me in, I’m turning in Darryl.
That’s just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let’s just…
Nobody’s going to prison, okay? Um… all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we’ll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
[sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.
Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them; Dwight’s phone rings] Got it? Oh shoot. Got it? [walks away, opens phone] Dwight Schrute.
[on phone] The property you’re looking at is in great shape. By the way, it has a very spacious basement office.
Basement office? You mean like a lair?
Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.
Well, deal with this. [crosses arms]
Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem, and now I got a branch manager who’s giving me the silent treatment… Speak to me… speak. [Jo’s dog barks] Come with me.
[as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I… should I continue with the investigation?
[on phone] I just need you to come by later and sign a few forms.
What time works for you? [Dwight looks across the street] Mr. Schrute, what time works?
Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make ’em an offer they can’t refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don’t call me ’til you have it.
[on Jo’s jet] Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but… I have an early dinner that I need to get to… with the Chief of Police.
I’m very relieved to learn it wasn’t you.
What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And… you did it. [nods at Andy]
Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?
Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don’t definitely know it was Andy.
Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been… Jim.
I am not going to tell you anything.
Honey, you don’t seem like your normal self.
Well, I’m going through a little bit of a rough patch.
Mama Jo knew there was something up.
Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.
Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It’s not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.
Well, I think that the real question is:
I may have heard from an old client, and I may have immediately started spreading the news to other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I’m not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about Suck It. Suck it.
Gabe, I told you all about the printers.
I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that’s the point.
I think we all can agree that it’s either Gabe or Angela. [flips a coin] It’s Angela. Get her, boys.
Hey guys, uh, sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone. Through Teach for America, I’m going to go down to Detroit and teach, uh, inner city kids about computers.
Oh yeah, it’s just that my friends are in the car waiting, so I thought I would…
[quietly] Phyllis, what’s this guy’s name again?
I don’t know, is it Shadow or Garth, it’s something weird, I…
Okay, well, Nick, we’re in a meeting.
Okay, look, I get it, people. I’m the lame IT guy, and everybody hates me.
Hey, listen man, you can’t take it personally.
You called me man? I just said my name just now, did you forget it already?
You, you guys have fifteen parties a week, you can’t learn my name?
When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I’d break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there… and they’d make a Barbie out of me.
I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it’s all I’ll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie.
You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
Oh honey, surely you don’t want that.
I, I surely do, and don’t call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too.
I’m about to buy this building, you know.
You don’t say? I own a one-eighth share in a rental property down in Pittston.
Well, I’m one-eighths proud of you… enjoy that chair for now… ’cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.
[points to the ceiling] You deserve it.
Look, I didn’t want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I…
Well, it doesn’t make me the worst guy in the world, either.
I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.
Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there.
Well, give me a shout if I can brighten your life.
Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.
This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
[closing door] I said I didn’t want to be on the internet!
[performs magic-tricks while lip-syncing]
Streamers! [everyone throws streamers in the air and starts dancing]
Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis’ desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]
Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk]
Whoo! We did it! [everyone starts cheering]
Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there.
And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher.
Who’s the guy who invented the peanut?
I’m gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao. [he and Erin kiss]
I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite.
Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he’s my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn’t have to, but… it’s been great.
[goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?
From now on, if you’re hot, sit on an ice pack.
Like you’d ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I’m too busy.
Hey, Dwight, I don’t know if you heard, but we’re supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.
[drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably.  Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.
The coffee’s supposed to be here at 9.
Here you go, Big O. Tiny. [hands Kevin his coffee] Darryl Hannah.
Ooh, yeah. Must’ve been some sort of mix-up there. You could just drink it, or I could drive all the way back?
My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don’t know how we’re going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He’s only been here for a week, and I hate him.
New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I’m the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.
My name is Luke Cooper. I love cinema. My favorite movies are Citizen Kane and The Boondock Saints.
That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.
He’s not the worst, okay? He’s not the worst. You know who’s the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. [starts drinking coffee] Ah! It’s not cappuccino.
It’s just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I’ll look into it, okay?
The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
That’s right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn’t know for sure cause I don’t have a trained ear. That’s why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope]
Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]
What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
[Jim quietly takes Dwight’s keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what’s so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.
Oh, no. Don’t worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but…
Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn’t get ’em.
Uh, if you asked me to do it, I’m sure I did it. Yeah, strawberries are ripe.
Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp.
Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.
To get some ice cream for everybody. It’s national ice cream afternoon. Great.
And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.
Why is there a circle with a line through it?
That means don’t. Haven’t you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?
Yeah, but it’s like you’re saying we should bother Luke.
No, it… Yes, okay, right. [erases don’t] All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go. [writes “Don’t”  in front of symbol]
Come on. Okay, um… [draws a circle around “Don’t” with a line through it] That’s as clear as I can make it.
Hey, why can’t we bother Luke? He deserves it.
Because I don’t want it getting back to Sabre that we’re yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.
That’d be hilarious. Uh, “Jo, they’re creating a hostile work environment. Stop  ’em.”
Nope, it won’t be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.
Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?
Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related.
No. No, Toby. He’s not. Yes he is. He’s my nephew.
Michael, that’s nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he’s your nephew.
Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
What’s wrong with a level playing field?
Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn’t even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.
I couldn’t care less about nepotism. But, I’m loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I’ve got a front row seat.
God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.
But you’re comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
No! No. I’m just saying, why does God get to do something that I don’t?
This is hypothetical. We’re talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
Well, then, why aren’t you bugging me to fire everybody who’s bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That’s reverse nepotism.  He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!
I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
If there’s nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
No, man. There was no list. Uh, but I got bagel chips.
Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
You really think you can make it up to me with food?
I feel horrible for blowing Jim’s prank. I don’t know if you can tell, but he’s mildly upset. And Dwight hasn’t been messed with in a while, so he’s become a monster. I need to make this right.
I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew’s car.
Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!
Well, take a look. It’s all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.
Yep. That’s exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, “I don’t own an Ebay store,” so…
Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.
Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
Let’s just make this kid open this damn car.
Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.
I’m reconsidering sending them back anyway.
You get that kid to open this car, or I’m gonna do it myself… by calling Tripple A.
Don’t-all right. Well, ok, you’ve just committed a felony.
Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
This kid’s costing us sales, Michael.
I’m sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
No, I know they fit. It’s not about the fit.
Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable.
Lower yourself, Gabe. I don’t wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Ok, educate me now why you won’t fire the boy.
Well, I got a nephew too. But he don’t work for me. You know why? Cause he’s a screw-up. He can swim in my pool but he can’t come in my house.
Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.
If you keep him, Michael, I’m gonna hold you accountable for him. You’re on the hook for this kid. You got that? Cover his ass like tighty-whities.
I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.
Was how I put it not clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys.
Oh, yeah. This’ll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.
Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses “Doors closed” the doors open. Or he presses “lobby” it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?
Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.
[as elevator doors won’t shut] Okay, that’s weird. Just hitting “door closed.” What?
Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors]  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.
Use your talons! Pry ’em open! [starts to urinate in elevator corner]
Dwight, what are you doing!? We’ve only been in here for, like, two seconds!
I’ve got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no! [Luke points laser at Oscar’s forehead] Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar’s head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!
What? I’m stopping it. That’s what you said.
So you just want me to move it? You’re being totally unclear here. I’m just gonna go ahead and move it. [points it at Angela’s chest]
No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela’s boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.
All right, fine. Fine. I’ll just go.
All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we’re starting with account setup-
Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he’s burning my eye.
Ok, I am going to count down from five.
[bending Luke over desk, spanking him repeatedly] You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!
That’s what you’re going to do, Luke!
All right. Are we good? [Luke runs out crying] You’re okay. He’s okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
He’s been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it’s funny stuff, but mean.
Everywhere I look it’s Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that’s not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him.
Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private?
Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?
Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.
I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.
Well, you know… they don’t call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.
Come on, give me your hand. I’ll help you down.
Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there’s pee on the floor.
Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
[Phyllis and Andy act out Luke getting spanked] No, no, no, no. It’s the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.
[Dwight starts aggressively spanking Andy] Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!
Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst.  You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.
That’s it? Really? That’s nothing. All right. That’s highway robbery.
And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors.
Yeah, I’m really looking forward to working with you, Michael.
The alternative is termination. [Michael stares off, considering termination…]
Why didn’t I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
Now that I own the building, I’m looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center… Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it’s not an evil idea. It’s just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.
Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English… uh… letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child’s imagination that’s Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and… Ms. Fork.
Oh! That shouldn’t have been in there. I’m embarrassed.
We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.
No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
But I’ll tell you this, if this works out, I think we’re looking real good.
I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door]
This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!
Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It’s over. It’s done. But my punishment is … um … worse than hell.
I know what you want to ask me. “Did your mom ever see you naked?”
So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don’t think so. We’re going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That’s the key.
Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!
The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.
Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board.
I’d like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it’s the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons.
I’m glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he’s stupid.
[on phone] Look, I’m not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.
I can’t do this. I don’t have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.
The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that’s fair.
Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the “F” word?
Yes I did. And I’m going to do the same with all of your clients.
Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They’re “appearance”ists!
Ok, Dwight. We can’t do that. So why don’t you just tell us what happened?
You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to “Pretty Woman” their asses.
Wait, wait, wait. That’s actually a really good idea Kelly.
I talk a lot, so I’ve learned to just tune myself out.
Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
No, you and I… and I. I’m going to come with you.
Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now?
Uh… what was your favorite flavor of…
One hour. We’ve done one hour. Let’s just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.
Ok, I can’t count the hour if you don’t talk.
No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.
Michael, it’s up to me to check off the boxes, and I can’t do that unless I honestly…
You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.
Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby.
Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980’s, Beautiful Girl…
Apparently, it’s one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist… That can’t be right. Andy? How does it…?
Ok, Um… The sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the “trappings” of extravagant wealth, but instead of going…
Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she’s like,” I was in here yesterday and you wouldn’t help me.” And the shop girl goes, “ok”. And Julia Roberts goes,” You girls work on commission, right?” And the girl is like,”Yeah”, and Julia Roberts goes…
I was telling that… I was telling that.
How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.
Who can I speak to in this office about saving on window treatments?
Is one of you the office administrator?
[hesitates] I am. I am the office administrator!
Oh, we’re not interested. We’re not interested at all.
There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That’s the main way. But this could work.
Toby, can I really tell you anything?
Office Administrator. So when did this happen?
A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn’t there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?
Thanks! Yeah, so I’m just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?
No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500.
Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.
No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo.
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?
The glasses are a little…  [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]
Say stuff like, “Good morning, Good Afternoon”. People appreciate that.
Wait, I see you every day. Can I say “Good month?”
If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you.
[in a cockney accent] I think he’s got it!
And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight? [howls and growls like a werewolf]
Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.
Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that? [pause] Three hours. We’re half way done.
Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I’ve been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.
And, I haven’t gotten paid yet. I’m not blaming you.
I just think somebody lost the paperwork.
Oh boy. Can you get every department head’s signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?
You know what Michael? You’re right. You win. This is pointless. We’re not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don’t we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?
We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
Dwight [snaps a picture with a disposable camera, then drops the camera in the trash can]
Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don’t ever get to see your pictures. If it’s an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don’t care if I forget today.
We can play something more complicated if you like.
I’ve played it once or twice with Jeff.
Jeff was my mother’s boyfriend, who she married.
Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though.
Did you guys do much stuff together?
My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit]
Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?
I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
I guess that’s why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
Right. Why would a dog do that? That’s silly.
When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I’ve never said it out loud, so…
It’s very important for you to be liked, isn’t it?
Well, lets not get too… This isn’t a counseling session… Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.
I’m just trying to help you Michael.
You. Bitch. God! You’re very helpful aren’t you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?
You are good. But you know what? You can’t help people. You couldn’t help your marriage. You lose. I don’t need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can’t help anybody. I don’t need your help! Am I going to make you cry?
[tossing forms at Michael] Just fill them out any way you want.
I’ll have Erin fax them back to corporate.
You’ll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these [giving Toby two middle fingers] and call me in the morning.
Hey Michael, um… about three months ago, I was talking to… [Michael grabs form and signs it without reading.]
There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there’s a lot of department heads. But I’m off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.
So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?
You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior.
I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh’s home office. All corkboard.
I’m back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem.
The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator.
So weird that there is no paperwork.
Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.
Pam, I don’t want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it’s supposed to be. Can you just admit… admit…
Say that I’m lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.
Statements of such nature, while they have their place, are overused in a competitive business environment.
Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.
Will do… Can I get one of those name plates… that says Gabe Lewis?
The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.
Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
Wait a second. You know you can’t buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I’m saying right now, we can’t do that.
Because I’m here for one thing. Revenge.
Let me know if I can help you with anything.
I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
I remember, yes. I’m terribly sorry about that.
Of course, but he looks much less threatening now.
We had a safety concern. Um… we very politely indicated that he’d be welcome back…
If he were in accordance with our dress policy.
It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi…
Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a… I’m gonna… Ok. Listen. You can’t treat… Thank you! Good morning sir!
[re-entering the store] I’ll take the wizard!
You forged them! You forged the forms!
You filled them in and faxed them yourself!
Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.
Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.
Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing]
[cheers loudly after cast finishes singing song] That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?
Really? They didn’t call me. Who am I playing? …Andy?
Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It’s closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton’s Miss Fitness pageant.
I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can’t come. Sorry.
What? That’s awful. Everyone’s gonna miss that guy.
Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It’s so powerful, even a lot of men can’t resist a man singing show tunes.
Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You’re all coming to my show tonight, right?
They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andy’s play, they took mine.
Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I’m really sorry.
Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
I can’t Andy, it’s too hard. That’s-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?
If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer.
This guy’s like world-class. You should not feel bad. I’m asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?
I wish I could, Andy, but I can’t. I have plans that night. I’m going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You’re that friend. I’m going to see your play.
Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy’s play tonight.
Please, waste of time. You know what? Let’s just knock this out right now. Disrobe.
Angela? Don’t like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.
Well, there’s a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?
Alright, fine. I’ll go to your little show, but I’m not wearing a cape.
Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. [faint smile]
My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could…
I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.
I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.
Excuse me, are you the guy who did an entire Law & Order episode for his audition?
You should actually thank Erin, she’s the one who agreed to babysit.
I really wanted to see Andy’s play, because he’s so, so talented. But I’ve been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It’s almost like a babysitters club.
I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her.
[trying to stuff balloons below the seats] This is ridiculous. You’d think they’d discourage people from bringing in balloons.
Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.
No, Darryl. This guy’s a world-class actor. He doesn’t daylight as your plumber.
No, it’s my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It’s his first play. He didn’t even audition.
Shhh. If we don’t listen to the overture, we won’t recognize the musical themes when they come back later.
Excuse me, I think you may be in the wrong seats. [Jim and Pam move a few rows back, next to Michael]
[whispering to man sitting beside him] I work with that guy.
[after taking her gum out] Ugh! There’s gum on the seat and now it’s on my work skirt. I have to go change.
Too bad I’m not gonna explain anything that you miss.
[whispering to man sitting beside him] His name’s Andy. He’s a terrible salesman.
What time is it? [Ryan pulls up a large analog clock on his iPad]
Michael! Shelby Thomas Weemes, the director.
I promise you that if you keep auditioning with similar gusto…
We are going to find a production with a role for Michael Scott.
Thank you. You, too. [steals a bottle of wine from the bar]
Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
We can relax. Let’s get our Sweeney on.
[seeing Michael drink from wine bottle] Michael! [bottle gets passed around by Darryl, Meredith and Kevin]
Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute “break a legs” or “I still love you” type texts. Doesn’t look like I got anything.  Maybe on my Facebook wall.
[on cell phone] Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph.
That monster of a judge has locked her-[cell phone chiming]. Locked her away. [phone continues ringing]
There’s a little bird fluttering around.  Do hope it ceases chirping. [audience laughs]
The bird continues to call. Someone please turn off your… bird. Oh, for the love-turn your phone off! There are signs!
Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He’s gone to sleep now, I’ve closed his beak. [Michael laughs]
What is the news of my darling daughter Johanna?
A madhouse? Johanna is as good as rescued. Where do you suppose all the wig makes of London go to obtain their human hair? [Michael tips over wine bottle, which noisily rolls down the theater, and accidentally lets go of balloons]
Do you think… [bottle rolling] so you think… [bottle rolling, clanking]
Fogg’s Asylum , why not? [balloon pops, Kelly screams and baby starts crying]
Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
[sees Erin holding Cece] Oh, my God! Go, go!
[excited] That’s really irresponsible of Erin. She’s a terrible babysitter.
I just didn’t think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
[overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.
What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don’t… you know, babies shouldn’t have ice cream, by the way.
I’m sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.
Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or…
Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?
You know what? It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter.
Why don’t I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.
Alright, well, we’re never leaving the house again.
[during curtain call for Sweeney Todd] Boo! Boo!
That was more horrifying than Nunsense.
All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it’s dried. I’ve already eaten, like, 30 apricots.
Didn’t know you were gonna be here. How’s the toilet?
I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn’t one of em.
No, I saw you, and you were the only one.
Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work.
Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn’t think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.
How would you like it if we booed you?
Yes. Oh, I’m so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!
[pretends to slit her throat] Ah! Blood everywhere.
Oh, no. I’m so glad we’re hanging out again outside of work.
No, actually, Dwight, I didn’t realize how far this walk was, and I-I’m exhausted.
No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it’s okay. This can count as one of your times.
No, no, no. Contractually we’re obligated to have sex.
I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you… [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card]
These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here.
[attempting to move car seat] It’s like The Hurt Locker!
No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn’t a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
Hey, what’s going on here? Post-show blues?
Yeah, I get those every day after work.
Interesting subject matter. I’m surprised you pulled it off.
It was an amateur production, technically.
Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome.
I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.
Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now.
Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.
Okay, all right, all right, all right.
[sings Macy Gray’s “I Try” and everyone joins in]
No, that was- I’m just getting into the first act.
We don’t go with that man. I’ve seen several men go with that man and not come back.
We don’t know what he does with them.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore.
I pick up day laborers and tell them they’ll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it’s Canada.
Scranton, y before that La Philadelphia.
[seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who’s this guy by our cars?
That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you’ll be happy to know that he’s taking care of that hornet’s nest that you’ve been griping about.
[looking outside through the window] I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he’ll conquer the hornets…
When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
No. No no no! [nos coming from all employees]
[Nate starts walking away from hornet’s nest, puts down the blowtorch] Yes!
[picks up baseball bat, heads towards hornet’s nest]
Oh it’s stinging him! Ow! Ow! [yelling all around the office]
[walks into the office with a large, fake mustache on] Good morning Erin, any mustaches? I mean messages?
There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work. [spinning in chair] He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves… other things as well.
[seeing a large red spot on Michael’s lip] God! Wow!
[shying away] Look, [sighs] It’s a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.
It’s just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It’s just a cold sore.
Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don’t have acne. I have a cold sore. I don’t even have a cold. I don’t know how I got it.
I know how you got it. [smug expression on his face]
Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don’t know what that is.
I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That’s what it is.
Because it’s on my genitals, genius.
Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?
Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
Why at least? If you’re guessing forty six just say forty six. [later in his office, places a band-aid over his cold sore]
Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
You know what guys, why don’t we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.
I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
I don’t even wanna know these things!
[walking in] Hey guys! [Angela leaves the table, exhales as she exits the room]
How did this happen, how did I get this?
Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. [in pirate voice] It’s me own damn fault. Woman in every port.
What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por…
Don’t even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
You need to contact every woman you’ve been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It’s the right thing to do.
[makes grunt in attempt to stop Dwight. Dwight hangs up]
Michael, I didn’t think I’d here from you. How have you been?
I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.
Wait, you’re calling to tell me that you have herpes?
No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?
No! He doesn’t. Are you telling me I have to get tested?
Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?
You’re always asking for our attention.
Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone’s attention, and it seems like you’ve done it on several occasions.
Everyone, I’ve noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices.
Oh! When you got your new phone, that’s when you asked for everyone’s attention.
[agreement around the office] That’s what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
It’s the world’s only international sport! [sits down]
Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.
I am calling because, there’s a terrible crash!
Three nuns, [Michael laughs] from a Missionary in South Africa.
[Dwight looks confused to the camera] Were they in the missionary position? [Holly laughs]
[still on phone with Holly] Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn’t been transferred?
We would have twins. [Dwight points towards the corner of his lip, indicating Michael’s “herpes”]
[sternly] Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.
I don’t romanticize th- [Dwight nodding and mouthing ‘Yes you do’] No…
Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.
He had no arms or legs, he couldn’t hear see, or speak… This is how he let a nation.
You made ourselves to be more than we were.
I don’t know what you’re getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.
[to the camera] He forgot to mention the herpes.
[to a client] …to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. [Seeing Michael and Dwight] Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it’ll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. [to client again] The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to…
How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I’d tell you.
Yeah I’m really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. [laughs] We’re loving it, yeah. I’m kind of a supermom.
Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget… [laughs] I love that commercial.
Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
We had to come over right away, it’s urgent. Michael has something to tell you. [Michael shushes him]
Are you gonna keep me in suspense? [Michael sighs]
[after long wait, to Dwight] Would you excuse us…
Ok I’m gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that’s open to visitors? Never mind I’ll find it.
Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.
You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I’m in.
Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I’m going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia. [Kevin is grossed out immediately. The office is grossed out]
Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
It’s normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It’s just as normal as anyone else’s.
No! In the beginning we were not good.
Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!
Well if there’s anything exciting about it it’s because we both knew it was wrong!
No, ok. Imagine there’s a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn’t like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn’t like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!
[sighs] Ok, so I’m the guy at the station.
You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we’re all, sisters and brothers.
I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong…
Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences?
[writing on board] Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels…
The ability to express love physically. It’s a magical thing.
Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?
I actually had that down in the cons column, but…
Ok, umm. I’ll move that. Thrill of risk.
Andy, aren’t there also negatives to sex?
Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
I’m sure they don’t regret having their child, let’s move it to the pros.
Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.
Next stop is Helene. You’re gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I’ll remind you.
You know, I don’t know if I trust Jan’s judgment. She…
No, I’m not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
[walks into park with Dwight] Hi stranger! Long time!
Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?
What is happening? [Dwight shushes her]
Who can tell me what the safest form of sex is?
Incorrect, the only true form of safe sex, ok? Abstinence.
Ohh. Ok. I didn’t realize we were doing trick questions. What’s the safest way to go skiing? Don’t ski! [office laughs]
I just thought I’d bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That’s all.  Anybody?
Andy that’s way too personal of a question.
Well someone could answer if they want to. [looks at Erin hopefully] Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on… using this pencil. [Stanley laughs]
Well I’m not gonna use my penis, Oscar! It’s not exactly hard right now anyway.
Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I’m doing right now?! [throws pizza box at painting and leaves]
It’ll go away in time just don’t touch it.
Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?
Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you…
I think for you to have come here even expecting that we can have a conversation like this show’s ho-how self deluded you are! Michael, your memory has failed you greatly.
Michael! [attempting to get out of the car on the side in which Michael parked too close to a bush. Michael ignores him and walks into a building.]
So this is the chef’s kitchen, which makes it perfect for real entertainers.
I’m great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I’m going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
You didn’t call my office and ask where I was?
Because the receptionist told me a man called but he only said he was my ex-lover.
I don’t know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.
This wasn’t really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.
I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, ‘My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.’ I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.
The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.
I’ll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you.
You put the TV here, you put the family over here.
Someone told me that I romanticize relationships
What? Did you have that while we were together?
I just found out today. It’s, uh, right there.
Oh! Oh, that’s what you’re talking about?
Yes, yes Michael. Actually you do make a bigger deal out of things than you need to. You proposed to me on our fourth date.
Well I believe in love at first sight.
Well so do I, but we didn’t love each other at first either. I don’t know what you were thinking!
I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
[walking downstairs] Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn’t they?
[Andy walks in Darryl’s office] We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
I don’t know who’s got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It’s all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
I have no idea what his problem is, that’s just my standard advice. It’s good advice right?
[on answering machine] This is Holly Flax, I can’t come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up. [BEEP]
Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?
You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
I’m gonna need a list of every man you’ve ever had sex with. I’m talking train stations, men’s rooms…
Flower shops, fireworks celebrations…
Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park…
The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk’s home.
An electric car dealership. [Oscar gets up and starts leaving]
Oscar! Think abou- Think! [door slams]
I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can’t wait to wake up every morning.
Can’t beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
Oh, look at that. [pushing bike]  Smooth roll.
His ass was on that seat? All right!
No, Meredith, that’s not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
I’m on Sheryl Crow’s side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike.
Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back…that support you. [Pam and Jim begin wheeling him] Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
[chanting] Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
[crashes into Jim and Pam’s parked car] Oh, my god!
Ow! [grunts, stumbles to his feet] You never forget. Whoo!
Well, I do the best with what I’ve got. Let’s go.
Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It’s weird if I come in slightly after.
We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.
He’s not the Steve Nash. He’s big though. He’s kind of like…Scranton’s Steve Nash.
Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they’ll understand? It’s condescending.
I’m not doing that. I’m just explaining.
Well, I’m neither of those things, so…
[reading Cornell magazine] Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dan’s Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God!
No, he died. It’s Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook.
Oh, that’s great news for your friend.
You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.
I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh.
Go tell her we’re here. You’re good with receptionists.
Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight…[motions to lobby]
The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.
No, he didn’t. [Dwight mouthing “yes, he did”]
Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
That’s fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.
No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right?
[speaking loudly] So anyway, she says, “that is the biggest penis I have ever seen.” And I said, “I know. That’s why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars.” Well, hello Danny!
Hey, Dwight. Good to see you. Jim, hey.
He’s not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea-[cell phone rings] Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?
Hey, it’s Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
Oh, hey. No, I’m not busy. What’s up?
Listen, you gotta get over here, ’cause we’re pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
The big gun thing. [Dwight grabs at phone] Stop!
I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight. [hangs up] Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I…and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
You don’t look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.
[laughing] No, I don’t have time for this. Are you kidding me?
No! Okay. [runs out the door] All right.
[knocking] Knockity-knock, don’t knock back. Just kidding you can knock; it’s your office. Do you have a minute?
I’m very busy with time-sensitive work.
Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that you’re entering points into Weight Watchers dot com.
If you don’t enter them immediately, you forget. What?
I’m starting a band and I need you on keyboards.
That’s crazy money. I’ll take forty.
That…hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.
Yeah, well…we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?
Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right.
It’s good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.
Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.
Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it’s showtime. Ready, one, two–
I’ve been in showtime mode since breakfast.
Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.
It’s showtime! Oh…never mind. Let’s go.
When I knock on your door, you know who it is; it’s Michael Scott. We’ve been together forever and we-
Michael, I appreciate everything that Dunder-Mifflin has done for this company.
You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We’re going to deliver to you on weekends.
And you know what else we’re gonna do? I can’t believe I’m gonna say this…we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you’d better shake my hand right now.
Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested. [pounds the elevator button] Why is there a door close button if it doesn’t even close the door?
How do I feel about losing the sale? It’s like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.
You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They’re a small company. They’re smaller than we are. What’s our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?
Okay. You know what? You clearly don’t care, so why don’t you just leave?
I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
Why don’t you go outside and…take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
I don’t know, your frame, your build-why don’t you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you’re not a diabetic. [Stanley stands to leave] See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?
What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.
You know what this is? This is a stinger.
Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They’re bank robbers.
Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and…that’s it. That’s really all we were looking for.
Danny Cordray. It’s great to meet you.
Meredith Van Helsing. Pleased to meet you.
Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
Okay. But what is he more famous for?
[singing] Please Mr. President, if you wanna give hope a whirl, bring our troops home safe and sound, says this little girl.
One second, one second, one second. [stops playing] So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
No, that’s not a good idea. I don’t see that as a very good song.
Yeah, well, it’d sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul.
I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.
But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who’s gonna win this one. Two, three, four-
I’m gonna take off my coat, if you don’t mind. It’s a bit warm in here.
People can’t keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
Okay, he’s not that good-looking. I don’t understand why everybody’s obsessed with this-
That’s a great set of shoulder’s you got there. What is that…Genetics? Creatine? [phone rings] Sorry. Yeah?
Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin’ at him.
I’m sorry. [hangs up] You’re here to sell me some paper.
Well, actually, uh… no, Miss Van Helsing, that’s not why I’m here. I’m here to meet you, see if we’d be a, you know, good fit.
Oh…my god! He’s making her sell to him.
[everyone finishes listening to song] Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?
It’s pandering. And it makes me think you think I’m stupid.
But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?
Not really. It’s kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics.
I-I don’t think they usually…skate to such…bad songs.
Well, I really, really, really liked it.
We should think of this as a first date. And I think it’s going very well, how ’bout you?
Real well. Uh…feels more like a third date to me.
Ha ha, okay, there you go! [phone rings, Meredith answers]
Shut up and let me do this! [hangs up] You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?
I’ve never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on…why not, huh?
Well, we’ll get this…[Meredith unbuttons]
So, what’s your drink? You a vodka man? Me too.
We gotta get someone else in there right now.
You’re an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
I told you! You’re an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-
Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here’s the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
So you’re taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
All right. I can do that. Then what?
And listen if anything else happens, just…roll with it.
Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn’t speak any English.
Okay. You’re a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You’ve just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It’s a whole new regime. He’s gotta pitch to you now.
Okay. Stark Industries isn’t real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
[points to Jim] Will do. [points to Michael] Won’t do.
You smell like a Scorpio. [Ryan enters] This is…Esteban…another cleaning man. He doesn’t speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.
You know what? I may have parked my car in a compact space, and I hate when I see others do that, so-
Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I’m-
Stop, stop! Oh, my god! [enters office] Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.
I said stop. Okay, Danny…this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-
Don’t! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.
I owe you…a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
A surveillance room next to this one.
Okay, so you…set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?
Yes. And it’s the sincerest form of flattery.
Okay. You know what, it wasn’t just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
Oh, well then, yeah. All right. Hey! [knocking on wall] Good luck, guys. Seems like you got a great operation here.
No, we don’t. Here’s-here’s my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.
What do you mean, my tricks? There’s no tricks, man. I’m just a good salesman. You wanna copy that? You can’t copy that! [opens door to leave]
You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop. [closes door] You are a good salesman. And because of that…I want you to work for me.
Sure. You seem like a fun, professional guy.
Hold it, hold it. [forcing door closed] Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better…or to be worse or to stay the same?
Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?
I swear to God, I’m gonna hit you. I didn’t mean that. I’m sorry. I’m not-it’s just I’m very upset right now.
Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!
O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site…or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?
No. No. No. Somebody in this office.
No, me. Right? Sorta like…a little younger version of me.
It’s hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn’t it.
It’s about this very announcement you just made.
Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
Okay. Let’s-all right, all right. Let’s talk. Please don’t let him leave. [pointing to Danny] Don’t leave. Don’t let him.
Gotcha. [they go into Michael’s office]
Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
Okay. Well…get ready, ’cause it’s gonna get better.
It’s not gonna get better; he’s gonna steal all of our clients.
No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can’t now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he’s going to steal sales for us.
Where’s he gonna sit? There’s no more seats.
He doesn’t need to sit, he’s a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.
Where’s he gonna park? There’s no more reserved parking spots.
What’s something you really care about?
Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by.
[plays soft chords and sings]  Couldn’t get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-that’s amazing!
[singing] Which me am I gonna be today?
I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?
Oh, my gosh! We’re almost out of time. How much for another half hour?
So we’re just, like, jamming as friends?
Oh, you know…funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates.
I’m just kidding. She told me about it.
Obviously. I don’t even think she called me back.
Oh, that’s different, is it? Okay…thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. [awkward pause] So…you’re gonna be workin’ here?
Hey, crazy, um…so…that’s it? You’re just-you’re fine?
It’s after 5:00, Jim. I’m not gonna take this home. [shakes Danny’s hand]
[singing and playing drums] Sun’s in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love. Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love and I gave her the croak that meant I love you.
[falsetto] I’ll be your croak madame.
Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I’m here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.
Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.
Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn’t seem to realize that it wasn’t his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won’t notice?
What’s a seven letter word for purse?
[sitting at Phyllis’ desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!
[shirtless, wearing only a tie] Handbag.
Shh! Shhh! [watches Jim put a cardboard box over Stanley’s monitor]
[standing outside the conference room, wearing fake teeth, watching Stanley walk in] All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!
[looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o’clock, I will see you all tomorrow:
[turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]
[standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!
So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you’ve heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!
[has his hands around Jim’s neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you’d be so strangled right now. If you’re out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.
Sounds like someone’s really trying to convince us that he’s not the Scranton Strangler.
To my chickens I’m the Scranton Strangler.  [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That’s very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute’s mom.
You’re only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
I’m supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I’m standing next to Popeye, but… Jim doesn’t want to put his costume on.
I’ve never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] …no.
[dressed as Lady Gaga] In case you can’t read m-m-my Poker Face… [laughs] we will be reviewing our sales policies. [accepts note from Michael, reads it out loud] I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.
Lame. Why don’t witches wear panties?
Because they need to grip the broom!
[laughs] OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?
When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they’re going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales.
So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?
Has anyone started calling you “Gabe-wad” yet?
Oh, so… I almost forgot. You’ll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That’s like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
Yeah. I’m sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.
I’m just glad we’re gonna try it out.
Okay. [reaches out and shakes Darryl’s hand] Okay.
Oh. It’s a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.
Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I’d like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they’re missing.
[leans hobo sack against the refrigerator] It’s a great stick, right?
It’s really good. It’s a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
Excuse me, everybody. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I’m having at my bar.
That’s a great name. You’re hilarious. A plus!
Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It’s all guys.
Hey, what’s the crowd like, Danny? Our age?
I don’t think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
I don’t know, they’re both handsome.
Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam.
So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
Except where Juliet doesn’t have that great a time and Romeo doesn’t call back after two dates.
But I’ve learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim’s shoulder] He’s a cartoon sailor.
And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?
I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I’m like an elephant in that way.
You know what else? [pulling fake teeth out of his mouth] The-this… this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don’t get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. [puts teeth back in]
Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl… Creed’s a maybe.
Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?
You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!
Yeah, I bet it is! If you’re gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.
Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]
[leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before… or sit on it.
This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin’s. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
And we are going to straighten this out.
Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.
Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so… no need to [mimicking Andy] screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let’s give Darryl a round of applause, as planned. [claps]
I’m a little peeved at Darryl right now.
No, he didn’t go behind my back. He went over my head.
He went over your head to go behind your back.
No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can’t have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
Yeah. Here’s another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl’s idea.
I’m really sorry, but we can’t come to your party tonight.
I was looking forward to throwing some darts with you guys.
Okay, well then, uh, I mean,  maybe we could do it like… next Halloween.
We’re just like, totally caught in the middle here.
Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go…
Jim and Pam really don’t want you to go?
They’re really upset about the whole Danny situation.
Yeah, but wait, don’t tell them that we said anything to you.
KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she’s out.
Um, if I’m out, I’m going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
Guys? You’re arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth… forty bucks.
This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don’t even want to give Pam a compliment, because she’s so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don’t need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can’t believe this doesn’t make you mad!
[staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?
Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry]
I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn’t tell you first.
[hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
Look, I’m just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.
Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It’s not even a history.
It’s not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don’t know about?
No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don’t know, you never called me back, so…
Oooh! You can’t handle the truth! [laughs]
[laughing] Well, that does not sound like me.
Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that’s what happened.
[stops laughing] Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren’t weird.
You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.
Well, I’m sorry if it seems that way to you.
Okay, that might help. If you said “I’m sorry” in front of everybody.
You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I’m not apologizing.
Sookehhh. [removes teeth] Bill Compton, from True Blood.
How many freakin’ vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
I guess you could say I’m still in costume. I’m a rational consumer.
Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I’m a rational consumer.
Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That’s a good line.
Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can’t vote for yourself.
Yeah, I gotta get in on this. [mocking Darryl] Hey, it’s cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I’m cool! I’m hip and I’m jive! And I don’t care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!
Still don’t know who I am? I’ll give you a hint. I go over other people’s heads.
Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?
NEVER! [tosses wig] Okay, you know what? Fine.  I’m not Darryl. And thank God I’m not Darryl.
Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
[walking down the runway] Raaah! [waves sword]
I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.
I don’t like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let’s not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
Hey, can I play? Why don’t you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?
We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.
Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?
Let’s just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?
[hands are being forced to the letters] A… S… S… H… E… T?
Ah! [lets go, candy corn flies everywhere] That’s enough.
I don’t think it’s gonna work out the way you think.
When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don’t work hard. Oh, here’s something. Uh, why didn’t you ever call Pam back?
Yeah. I mean, I’m not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I’m just saying… but you know, to not even call her back is…
You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and…
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
Halpert, you lookin’ for someone to bang your wife?
Okay. You wanna know?  I didn’t call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.
Wait, wait. She hasn’t moved in awhile.
[reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!
Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
I’d remember talking about Jim. That wasn’t it.
Do you honestly want to know why I didn’t call her back on a date over four years ago?
Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
I did. And it’s just one of those things that’s going to keep gnawing at me, like “gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn’t he? I have no idea why.”
Okay. Honestly. I didn’t call you back because I-thought you seemed a little… dorky.
Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.
In the future, you need to get Michael’s approval on anything before coming to me.
You’re gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
Okay, well, obviously if it’s a really, really good idea, my door is open.
If they’re good ideas, I’m not gonna say no!
That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?
Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you’ve ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? [explosion noise] This really make you think, Michael?
Stop it! Stop, stop. We’re thinking. We’re thinking about it.
You don’t have to point to the fact that we’re thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.
I don’t understand the point of a hat.
Okay. We’re going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.
Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.
Okay, why don’t we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.
Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we’ll give her a call.
Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day.  Bernard’s Regards.
No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
To be honest, I still can’t believe he didn’t call her back. Who doesn’t call a dork like that back?
[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]
Okay, everyone, I’ve tallied the votes, and the winner… of the costume celebration spectacular… and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book… Oscar Martinez.
If I have to vote for someone, I don’t want it to be someone who can beat me.
Best Edward James Olmos costume I’ve ever seen. Like, freaky good.
That’s true, that’s true. I dated her momma, and you know what-
[under his breath] Um… kay. Uh, alright.
One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
Oh, no, it’s just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]
Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] ‘Cause of the euro.
Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don’t come in if you’re sick.
[rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh…
And get your flu shot. Also, I’m going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.
NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
I’m not – I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to do that.
Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You’re welcome.
The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don’t know why everyone doesn’t do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.
Jim. Pam. [gasps, speaks in baby voice] And the precious bundle of God’s gift to everything. [back to her normal voice] I wish you both a pleasant day. [baby voice] And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
Everyone from work is here. We weren’t planning on that.
And a top of the day to you too, sir.
Hope you brought your pipes. We’re about to smoke the opium of the masses.
Oh, yes. [mimicking smoking] Doobie-doobie doo.
I invited everyone in the office because it’s not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate… my joy. And our, all of ours joys.
[looking at Cece, under his breath] Ah, man. [looks at Erin talking to Gabe]
Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol’ litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put ’em in a box, give ’em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.
[handing out cards] For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
Sunday church service… it’s been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do.
[in an old man mobster voice] Hey. Hey. I got an offer that you can’t refuse. Scooch over.
Oh, Michael, this is just for family.
It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.
Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I’m so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you’re not Cece’s godfather.
I’m sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I’m so sorry.
[normal voice] I’m not the godfather.
[clears his throat] So who is the godfather?
Our friend, Seth, and his wife there.
Okay. Old friend, like, you’ve known him since kindergarten?
No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They’re a great couple. You should meet them later.
No, I have plenty of friends, so… all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.
Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.
I don’t even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that’s not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.
[singing] We ask you, Lord, come to our aid.
What a terrific day this is, and not just because the Eagles are playing. [laughter, Kevin giggles]
You may have seen the bus out front. Today we also say good-bye to our young adult ministry. They’re leaving for three months to build a school for the village of Quimixto, in Cabo Corrientes, Mexico.
I’ve heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
[stands outside church entrance] Okay, this is, all right, this is silly. [goes inside] [walks back out] Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope…
And thank you for your prayers for Justin. We hope for a speedy recovery.
Thank you. Anyone else with a prayer or a remembrance? [Dwight and an eldery man stand up at the same time, Dwight stares at him, man sits back down]
Christening calls to repentance, to faithfulness, and to discipleship. We’ve come to celebrate these babies.
[looking at Cece’s diaper] Somebody needs a change.
Well, she can’t bring this up with her.
Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We’re gonna take a little field trip.
[whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There’s my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What’s that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
[seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What?
No. There’s no extra outfit in the bag.
At this time, will the families please come join me?
Before we go, I’d like to remind everyone that the “Halberts” have been kind enough to host a reception next door immediately following the service.
Okay, “A,” Halbert. And, “B,” I think a more appropriate statement would be, “The ‘Halberts’ are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.”
For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
[walking around and greeting people] How are you? Good morning. Good morning.
I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people.
We just had to add a few more tables. We weren’t expecting this many people.
Nope, and we’re gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed ’em all.
Jesus is not your caterer. [baby voice to Cece] But he should be your caterer ’cause you’re a little angel. Why didn’t your parents get you a caterer? [normal voice] They don’t think.
[to Cece] Hm. Don’t listen to her. She’s just jealous ’cause she doesn’t get to come home to someone as cute as you.
Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
Okay, well, you know what? Everybody’s hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I’m just hungry.
[laughs] I’m gonna use that one. Have a good lunch.
This is not the meal I was promised. I’m going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
You know what, guys, let’s just enjoy lunch.
With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes.
Excuse me, everyone, on behalf of the youth ministry that’s leaving for Mexico, I just wanted to thank our hosts and tell you about those good-looking guys and gals over there. [group of young adults cheer and applaud]
[whispering] Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they’re nuts.
This is Jessica Ortega. I met her when both she and I were both seven years old when my parents took me to Quimixto on a service trip.
[chuckling] Who takes a kid to Mexico?
I would run to Mexico if that’s where the sandwiches are.
Right now, Jessica’s children have to walk twelve miles to a school with dirt floors.
It’s gonna be three months of hard work and when we’re done, we’ll practically be Quimixtanos.
Greg, hello, it’s Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
[overhearing Dwight’s conversation] Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.
I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
My parents explained it to me this way. You wouldn’t hesitate to save a family member from a burning building, but what if the earth was your building and all the people on it were your family?
What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?
[holding up an empty serving dish] What was this? You’re out of it.
Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn’t get one either.
Is it just the one jug of apple cider? [Pam shrugs, woman walks away]
I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
We need more food. I’ll go get some subs and sodas.
Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
Yeah, well, that’s just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don’t have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.
We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don’t worry. She’s asleep. I’m just gonna track down some more chairs.
Fine, fine. I guess I’ll watch Suzanne’s purse and your baby.
[standing in a line saying goodbye to the kids going to Mexico] Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. We’re proud of you. [starts to walk down through the line and into the bus] Bye. Okay.
[on the bus] Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?
[in reference to the team shirts] I’ll take a shirt.
Really? [cheers, applause] Thank you. All right.
[seeing Michael on the bus] Michael. Get off the bus.
No, I’m not. I’m staying on the bus. I’m already on the bus. I’m going.
It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales.
You know what, my job will be here when I get back.
Michael, you can’t go to Mexico. You don’t have your passport.
[sticking his head out Michael’s window on the bus] You don’t need one to get in. Plus, we can just have it sent to him down in Mexico.
Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
Michael, I’m just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
I think it’s really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
[looking at Erin] Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I’m coming!
I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick.
We’re actually building them a school.
Whatever. I won’t-I won’t stand for it.
[waving goodbye as the bus drives away] See you in a few months.
If the whole world were like you guys, we wouldn’t have so many problems.
I know. Nobody I know would leave their jobs and friends and families to do manual labor for three months.
Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So…
Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals…
[standing in the church sanctuary, talking to the stained glass] Why you always got to be so mean to me?
[seeing Cece gone from the couch he left her] Uh, MeeMaw, where’s Cece?
Well, two days minus how long we’ve been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.
Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?
I don’t know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or…
Why aren’t they building it themselves?
Do we know how? I don’t know how. You know how?
Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?
What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?
Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?
Oh, God, you know what? I’m gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday.
No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven’t even started. Now we’re those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.
Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?
Jim, Jim, I want to give a toast. Where’s the little girl of honor?
I don’t mean to bug, but do you know when those subs are due into port? I got a hungry bunch of Mcphersons over there.
I don’t know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
I think maybe some blonde lady had her.
Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
[as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing?
[reaching into her purse] Give me the baby!
[holding the baby, walks up to Jim] Hi, honey. I was just changing the baby.
[to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.
What’s that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don’t, because I’ve got my eye on you.
[gasping as he looks into Angela’s purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
[to Pam] So that was lunch, eh? Mcpherson troop, let’s haul out. Rendezvous at Friendly’s.
Can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?
Should I-I got it. I got it. [walks up to the bus driver] Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view.
Well, uh, there’s a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road.
Maybe we’ll stop in Tennesseee. It’s not safe to talk to a driver.
[having walked up to the front] Okay, driver, driver, if you’re not gonna stop this bus, then I’m going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on. [pulls the string to request a stop, makes a dinging sound]
Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.
Just make him stop the freaking bus!
I didn’t sign up for this. You guys are young, that’s great. You want to give back to society. I’ve done that. I need to take.
You have plenty left to give. You’re doing-
We could go back and forth all day. It’s not gonna solve anything.
If we went to Mexico, we’d probably screw everything up anyway.
Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don’t. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?
[shouting and clapping] Stop the bus! Stop the bus!
[bus stopping] Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. We’ll keep an eye on America for you.
[getting off the bus] Wait for me! [bus drives away] Don’t say anything to my parents.
[driving up to pick up Michael, Andy, and kid off the road] Get in quick.
Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith’s minivan.
It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.
Oh, Lake Wobblegone’s on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
“… banana bread, but Fred Nordquist had no appetite. He was thinking about his pair of new boots. It’d been ten years after all. As he told Mrs. Nordquist, it would take two years to get comfortable with the new boots.”
[whispering to Pam] They have him surrounded. It’s the SWAT. The SWAT’s arriving.
It is unknown if he is armed with anything.
They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
[sighs] They shouldn’t televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it’s another Waco.
Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson’s funeral. Things that if you didn’t see them live, you wouldn’t really care that you didn’t see them at all.
Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up]
I bet he’s wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city.
No! I bet he’s wishing he was strangling someone!
Ok, that’s our street! That’s our street! He’s going down our street! [runs out of conference room.] Come on everybody! [all quickly follow]
[on sidewalk] There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it! [all groan]
Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone’s invited, and it’s at his house apartment and we’re gonna watch Glee.
[obviously faking being serious the whole time] Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!
Dwight! Sign please. I don’t have time for parties I don’t have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?
Cancel it! Are you still here? [to Erin]
Uhh. It’s just that it’s our first party together so…
MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I’m a very busy man. I don’t have time for your TV show.
I’m joking. I’m kidding around! I’m not actually angry. [Erin laughs] I’m not busy at all, I’m not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I’m a total Gleek.
You know who my favorite character is? The invalid. [Jim makes a face] I am coming to your party.
I don’t know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there’s this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don’t go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
[reacting to Erin’s invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn’t know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he’s this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
And what was with Jesse’s sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it’s just. It’s irresponsible.
Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that’s a show I’d watch.
Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
[to Erin] You’re having a party at Gabe’s apartment?
Mhmm! I’d love it if you were there.
You and Michael are always the life of the party!
Try and hide it, I will track this party down!
Yeah! You gotta go to the boss’s party!
What? No Gabe is… Gabe is not the boss.
Why did you just say he was the boss?
Yeeee… Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?
[to Michael at Gabe’s apartment] It’s make your own pizza night. Isn’t Gabe’s place so nice?
Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
Those posters used to be real French ads.
So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here’s what’s been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and…
Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you. [throws pizza dough, hits the ceiling]
[walking with Jim and Pam] Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.
Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.
Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I’m up all day and I’m up all night. And if it doesn’t stop soon, I am going to be up all night.
[peeking into various rooms] The show’s starting. The show’s starting! The show’s starting! Show’s starting! [Glee begins as all get nearby to watch]
Where’s Michael? Where’s Michael? We can’t start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin! [turning up volume]
Actually I think it’s not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah! [takes remote, raises volume] There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
[lowers volum] Some of us are trying to have a conversation.
Well some of us are trying to have a…
[grabs different remote from the table] Well I will turn up the volume.
Okay…  Heeeere’s what we’re gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!
[noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She’s been in a couple episodes of Friday Night…
You know what? I’m so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? ‘Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from…
You know what? I didn’t read the rules, I didn’t know the rules. There, it’s on. I didn’t read the rule book.
[enters on Michael alone sitting on a bed watching Glee] Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It’s closer to the TV. It’ll seem louder.
Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I’m dead. Okay?
What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
[Pam in the background struggling with Cece] Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.
Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn’t follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
Wow, so much Asia stuff. I wonder if there’s a guy in China right now, looking at a bunch of our stuff.
Andy look, all I know is that if I was a girl, and I had to choose between the tall dude who loved Asia, and the you looking dude who loves sweaters and wearing sweaters… I’d choose you.
[pours powdered seahorse into his wine glass]
[changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]
Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
This is why Erin! We’re living it! Start recording now!
Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] ‘Cause we missed it!
If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some [Dwight shushes her] help so, [Erin whispering] he was wondering if you could help him. [Michael goes with Erin]
[enters room where Phyllis is pouring wine, using stadium announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance! [sniffs her] Isn’t that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?
I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe’s doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
Look who I found! [points to Michael]
Yeah, well I wasn’t very hard to find.
Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
So these are pizza dogs, they aren’t pigs in a blanket per se.
Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
What’s the longest thing you’ve ever seen? [Michael chuckles] For me it was the tale from Jets.
Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.
[grimacing] That’s what she said. [leaves]
[whispers in Dwight’s ear] Outside my car in two minutes.
Well something’s come up, I have to go.
Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I’ve always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?
I do. But you married my worst enemy.
Well I think enemy’s a strong word. ‘Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
[outside opening Gabe’s cable hookup box] Okay… Alright.
And the winner is, by two votes- [TV goes blank]
[muttering going on all around, Andy looks sick] Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?
HI mahhhh. Boo yowww. Gunjo! Ooh uncow!
[concerned] Are you having a good time?
Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?
You’re four seasons in a day. [heaves] You… got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- [heaves again] Put if you put on a blue… [stops, is struggling] It’s Spring Time in the Rockies!
[referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth.
That’s not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
Jim, just don’t think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
I’d prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
Okay… [puts pizza into Dwight’s mouth]
No. Crust first. [Jim turns the pizza around] Okay, now the beer. [Jim shakes his head no] Beer me Jim. [Jim quickly puts the beer into his face] Ssss. Gentle. [drinks the beer] Now I’ve gotta go meet Angela.
What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We’re in the real world. Sex contracts exist!
Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
You ever been with the blondes before? It’s the big leagues.
I’m going home, and I’m taking my baby with me.
No no no, don’t. I will go talk to Angela.
She’s in heat. She will eat your face off!
The reverse cycling ends tonight! [Pam leaves]
[to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please.
I’m not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]
[getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!
[throws up on bed] Puts pillow in front of the puke.
I know. I thought you two were nice together.
Well girls tell each other things right?
[Michael walks into disarray of people’s reactions to the TV going out] Where you been?
What does that mean? Party’s over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?
[receiving message on his phone] Hey! Puck and Finn worked it out, and the solo is now a duet.
Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don’t know if it’s gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I’m gonna give it shot. [hurries out]
Please Michael, just make the Glee happen!
Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
Of course you don’t wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn’t even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
[knocking on Angela’s car window, Angela is naked inside] Hey in there. It’s Pam. It’s not Dwight! Don’t think it’s Dwight!
I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone.
Ok, uhm, then tell him that we’ll do this tomorrow night instead.
Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-
[Michael is outside fixing the cable box] You did this?
No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.
What is there to like? He’s just, he’s a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
Why? I’m not your father. [Erin looks sad] All right.
[slowly getting it] Uhm, I’m not going to my room.
You listen to me. You listen good. You are are
As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.
I’ll raise it how I want! I’ll raise the roof!
[enters, looks to Gabe] If you break that girl’s heart, I will kill you. It’s just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl’s heart I will literally kill you and your entire family.
Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl’s gonna turn my hair gray.
[Andy is leaning over toilet] What happened?
I didn’t know it’s powdered, so like four or five, I don’t know.
I’ve got just the thing! [leaves, comes back with a synthesizer] This one’s called Earth Rise, on the Moon. [music plays]
Uh, it’s saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? ‘Cause otherwise we can’t do any work.
Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.
Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?
Lord of the Ring stuff? I don’t know, I’m just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.
Um, everyone was getting their driver’s license.
Why don’t we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What’s the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been…  Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it.
You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended.
That’s– [ding] the password. We’re in.
The important thing is… this kept us secure people.
[wearing Ryan’s glasses] I’m Facebook.
I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven’t heard anything back.
[pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up]
[getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin.
Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator–
Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It’s actually a great idea and I can’t believe it didn’t exist before. And I know Ryan’s kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I’ve done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.
I think an investor’s ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.
I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I’ve never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop.
Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
New Investors are key, though. That’s actually why I came in today.
[chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven’t invested yet.
Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
[out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.
Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!
Hey, I’m kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
Yes, why don’t we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh… I’ve got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.
So, uh… [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.
[on phone] All right, Thank you, I will–I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]
Commission comes out to… dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero.
Mm-Kay, Well, it can’t be zero, Kev.
I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, “dunh-duh-na-dah!” I’m pretty sure I timesed it right.
You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.
What are you talking about? We–we have a commission cap?
Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn’t this where you fell in love?
A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
My gym allows it. I wish they didn’t, but it’s policy. So I respect it, and I just–[put’s his hands cupped by his face and turns away] keep a low–you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room.
Excuse me, everyone… SEX! Now that I have your attention…
You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
Wuphf! All right, I’ve warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.
Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I’m describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]
For my current investors, things are going great.
Washington University. I don’t even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
So I’ve decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
Oh, God. Hold on to your wallets, ladies.
Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
No, no–Oscar, it’s not–it’s not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
Well, it’s tight, as with any start-up.
Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep ’em coming.
Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.
Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I’ve cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So… what now?
Pam. Okay, now I’ve tried everything.
Yeah, it’s not as fun if I’m not blowing off work.
I love you, but I’m kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.
[blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles]
Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
[colorful poster with numbers] Check this out.
Look at that. Triple your investment by January.
Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?
Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it’s all over.
Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I’ll be right back.
[hits the back of a Dunder-Mifflin Delivery Truck with his hand] Hey kids, was that fun?
Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn’t get me off the hayride! But it’s gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks]
Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing… and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
[waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]
Where have you been?! I’ve been waiting.
Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
No, I–I think you should make time for it.
Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?
Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you’re at spring break, Daytona Beach.
Everyone’s like, “Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?” Or, Uh, “Hey, what’s up with that helicopter? It’s Ry from WUPHF!”
“What’s he dropping?! Wow, what’s falling on us, man?!” WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!
Look at that! He threw ’em on the ground!
Look, this is a marketing campgain. You got nine days. Let’s say you do get the money. What are you going to do with it?
The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don’t think about the money. Ever.
No, it’s not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that.
[walks in] Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
[whispering] I got this, it’s okay. Don’t worry about this.
Is it any particular branch of Washington University?
The Washington University Public Health Fund.
If everybody wants to sell, we sell, right?
I won’t sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn’t that right?
I–yes. We’re not selling. I will not sell.
[runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome!
There’s no charge to sit on the hay, is there?
I mean, wouldn’t you think the ten dollars to build your own broom would include the hay and not just the instructions?
I mean, I’m starting to think this guy is just trying to make money off the holiday.
Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don’t laugh at me.
No, no, no, I wasn’t–I was just laughing at your joke.
Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]
[stuck in the maze, says to some kids running around in the maze] You guys know how to get out? [kids run away screaming]
We Don’t? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?
I’m sure no one asked you to do that.
[throws the sack of garbage onto the floor] Eight Years.
Listen, I know you really like Ryan–
Michael, I… [sits down] I hate to say this, but… you know this special bond that you’ve always felt with Ryan, where, like, you’re best friends or you’re his mentor or something?
Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor.
Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he’s taking advantage of you.
And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
I’m just saying that I think I agree with your point.
Yeah, but in a jokey way where you’re gonna start singing.
I thought it might make me feel better.
[singing] But it just may be a lunatic… [stops singing] No.
[hovering over Meredith’s desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
Hey, kid–hear you’re looking for work.
How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? [Jim reaching his arms out as far as he can go] Eh, put ’em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? [Jim inhales] Good.
Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people?
We’re working. [Jim still holding his breath]
[listening to and editing Jo’s book on tape]
Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?
I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
Look, I know I’ve tapped you so hard.
[laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You–people, people don’t give you enough credit.
Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.
Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don’t seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
So you would think that’s a good idea for me to do?
Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot–
Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so…
Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
So, if I were to call Dunder Mifflin and ask for Miss Angela Martin, would I get through to you?
You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
My wife passed away a few years ago.
How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.
[still stuck in maze] Help! Hello?! Oh! Help![runs around the maze]
[opens the door the Ryan’s office, grabs him by the shirt, pulls him out of his chair] Consider it a WUPHF in person. [shoves Ryan down to a chair]
Your doing the wrong thing. You’re gonna lose Michael’s investment. You’re gonna lose ours.
You got this crazy opportunity to get our money back. Tell Mike To Sell.
If you tell Michael to sell, he’ll sell.
Hey. It’s an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they’re wrong?
It’s not that we don’t believe in the company, We don’t believe in you.
All those in favor of selling, say aye. [all say “aye”]
I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.
What is wrong with you? What happened to you in High School?
Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody’s money.
Oh… Uh, That’s a lot of pressure. I–I’m gonna need some more time.
Okay. I won’t let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door]
Angela? [slides open the door] Angela! [see’s a note on the door, reads it, and then crumples it up]
WUPHF, from Ryan Howard. Decided to sell company. Thanks, bro. Hell of a ride.
[puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe]
[Jim’s edited version of her book on tape]:
[opens door to Gabe’s office] All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. [Gabe motions that he’s on the phone] ‘Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
I’ve always been a fighter. And Fate has obliged me with plenty of battles, the first being a hard–
I’m sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
[typing with his toes] D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
[whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight’s desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
Oh, don’t worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
[spills hot coffee on himself] Uhh, aah!
Welcome, start your morning right with a burst of blueberry. Or try plain.
Dwight said this entry was a waste of space.
I would like a muffa du blueberry por favor.
[examines items on the reception desk] Mmhmm, China. China.
Everything here was made in China, Pam.
They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we’re falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.
Yeah, right here. It is right there. [holds up magazine] Anybody read the news any more?
I found that in the waiting room at the dentist’s office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that’s the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again.
My whole life I believed that America was number one, that was the saying. Not America is number two. England is number two. China should be like eight.
But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It’s insane.
You need to change your standard for what’s worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they’d all say the same thing. “I’m coming over baby.” And I would text back “BTB”, bring that booty.
Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?
I’m sorry, isn’t that good enough for your anus? Don’t get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.
Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to…
Don’t tell me how to do my business.
Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?
Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks.
Pam, when I’m sitting at this desk, I’m a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.
Well then you’re not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he’s a very reasonable guy.
Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.
Let me put you on hold for just one ‘eensy sec.
[answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I’m busy. I don’t know, make something up.
Hey Pam, Dwight’s being questioned by the police in connection with a string of dog-nappings that ha…
[hangs up phone] Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he’s worked with for years. His friends.
You know what Pam? You’re right. This isn’t just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. [Kevin smiles]
According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.
So much for keeping our secrets up high.
I know what we’re going to do. We’re going to put our best minds on it.
Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes.
How do we stop it? With a big idea. That’s what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?
An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?
An antacid that you only take once a week.
Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are… yes.
Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don’t you?
I think that’s what they’re doing to me. I can’t prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
I don’t know what the [expletive] that was.
I say we bomb ’em. By 2020, they’re gonna be the world’s largest economy and they’re getting a taste for protein. We’ll all starve.
Yeah, Dwight’s right we should drop a bomb.
No he’s not right. We’re not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.
Actually, that’s not true. I know the figure you’re referring to, and it’s a projection of fifteen years from now.
Michael, China’s agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet ‘cha, but still agrarian.
Where are you getting this information?
Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
[reads text] “Are you watching this?” Seriously?
Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has… nine.
Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
Great. I was wrong. I’m wrong. Is everyone happy?
So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? [laughs] I don’t care.
Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?
Wow, so this building can get uglier.
I will not work in a roach billboard.
Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.
Or else? Or else what? There’s nothing you can do.
[lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]
So, does anyone wanna know where I’ve been for the last 2 hours?
Oh God, I’ve been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
I went out to look for a better office space.
Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.
Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don’t undo all the changes you’ve made, we’re moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.
[without looking at the pictures] Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you.
This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.
Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
Well, this building isn’t far, and its much newer. There’s a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it’s next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.
Is the nail place Koreans or whites?
Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We’ve got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
I have a computer question. Hey Oscar?
Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
Not if the printer isn’t hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.
Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
He’s… he’s not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.
Around here, Oscar is known as ‘actually’ because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
[reading text] Megan Fox. Question mark. What’s that mean?
You know what, you’re one bad text away from getting blocked.
Yes, but one good text away from a high five.
In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I’m putting together kind of a wish list.
Yeah, no. I’m not a genie. I’m just talking about a…
I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.
Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don’t have time. Okay, okay, I’ll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.
I’m pretty good on politics. “California is bankrupt, and California, California.” [Jim and Andy follow Michael into his office] What?
Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.
Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
We need everything back the way it was.
Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don’t know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know.
I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.
Michael, I have to tell you something it’s from Rocky II.
This guy doesn’t just wanna win. Y’know, he want’s to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!
Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?
I’m like a quarter of the way through.
Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
[riding in car, looking for new office] Ten thousand seven hundred and six.
Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.
There’s no building. This could only mean one thing.
I’m sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
So, okay. You’re not a liar too are you?
Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.
I can’t wait to do to Pam, what I just did… to Pam.
Y’know what, I’m the only one here who you haven’t asked about the new office.
I know, because you’re the reason we’re moving.
Yeah, but I’m still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What’s the square footage in the new place?
Uhh, I think it’s something like umm…
How many offices are there? Oh I’ll just look at the one sheet myself.
Oh, actually I don’t know what I did with the one sheet. Y’know, that’s the problem. You only have one sheet.
[chuckles] You’re a funny guy Pam. What’s the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I’m going to walk down the hall and say “Wow, I can’t believe this is real, but it is.” I can’t wait.
I lied about some aspects of the building.
It’s still on a bike path though right?
There’s no building… it doesn’t exist.
I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It’s just this Office Administrator thing, I don’t wanna…
And that’s what you said about Art School, and that’s what you said about sales.
And you didn’t fail those things either.
Well, I’m not an artist, and I’m not a salesman. So what would you call it?
Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I’ve been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?
Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that’s just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon.
I wasn’t here. [places a book in front of Pam]
I wasn’t here. It’s a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use.
China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.
Actually, we’re in a mild recession right now. I’ll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?
Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy’s heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I’d say that’s far more relevant. Wouldn’t you?
Hello, hello. You’re breaking the law.
I see I’ve underestimated you, and I didn’t think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.
Don’t worry about the coffee, its on me.
Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.
My point is… that as long as people like you and me don’t stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.
Raise your cups on high. Case closed.
That wasn’t what we were discu… That wasn’t the whole…
[reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
Shhh. You’re gonna scare ’em away. [two pigeons are eating out of a soft serve cone]
[laughs] That’s a text. [high fives Andy]
People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We’re gonna do a fun one.
One Charlie’s Angels. One. Let’s go.
Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one’s putting this on their fridge.
Oh, I got it, you guys, how ’bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, ‘why I oughta’, and the girls are like, ‘let’s go shopping!’.
That’s it! That’s a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We’re gonna jump in the air. Here we go.
One, two, three. [everyone jumps at different times] Not everyone jumped.
Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.
One, two, three. [everyone jumps] Still some people not jumping.
You gotta be kidding me. Who isn’t jumping?
I’ll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
Let me see you jump. [Phyllis barely jumps] Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn’t one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She’s on the ground by ‘three’.
Well, if we all jump really high, we’ll be in the air longer. Do that.
Don’t answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we’re all in the air at the same time. Yes?
I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three, [some people jump] two, [others jump] one, [others jump] zero. [everyone begins to yell]
Why’s it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah… good one.
Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children! [dressed as Santa]
No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?
Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What’s the problem?
So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
[cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I’m doing fine.
Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?
Well, that’s a relief. Santa’s gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!
My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that’s what I want. That’s what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama.
It’s present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
We just want to say how grateful we are.
Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, “Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.”
I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
I said, “I wonder.” I didn’t say, “I think.”
Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.
Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we’re still dating?
I’ll take one of those pink pouches.
[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]
Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
Well, it’s not a snowball, ’cause it’s only a dusting. Right?
Look at that. There’s a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
Yeah, who’s a little girl now? [everyone laughs]
Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?
No, Andy, it’s a snowball fight. It’s not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight’s hand] Jim, let go. Let go.
Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
I wouldn’t subject Robert to that. He’s a very busy senator.
I would not expect you to know what it’s like to date someone in the public arena.
Who are you dating in the public arena?
We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller’s wife.
Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. “Angela…” [imitates camera shooting] “over here, Angela…” [imitates camera shooting] “here. Look here!”
Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that…
A party. It’s not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I’ll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.
Uh, because you’ve been on the Lam? Because the ‘boring police’ have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.
Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!
Okay, that’s hurtful talk. We’ve talked about that. You know, I don’t interrupt your announcements.
You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?
Well, I really can’t talk about it, but it’s a very high profile case.
Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?
Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?
Guys, it’s a really big deal. [rubs his neck]
He’s rubbing his neck. He’s rubbing his neck!
I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let’s just say I’ll be up to my neck in jury duty. [excited outbursts]
Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.
Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.
Yeah, uh, she’ll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.
That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
Holly’s coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.
I’m not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.
You know what, we’ll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.
Cancel. We’re canceling it. [Michael starts to throw away all of the food]
No, no, no, we’re gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.
It’s not. They’re not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.
Michael, Michael, wait we don’t have, we don’t have the budget for another party.
Well then everybody’ll chip in, it’ll be fine.
I honestly think you’re idealizing people here again, Michael. I don’t think that’s gonna happen.
You know what, I’ll pay for it. I’ll pay for the party. It doesn’t matter. This is way too important. People, Holly’s coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.
Just stop moving your calves so much while you’re talking.
Maybe I’ll bring my boyfriend. I’ll invite him.
I mean, unless there’s any chance there could be press at this party.
Well, I only ask because he’s a senator.
Could he help us with some parking tickets?
We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
Yes. But don’t get too excited, ’cause I didn’t have a lot of time this year.
[A note is on Jim’s computer that says, “It is time. Parking lot at noon.” Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]
Okay… [sighs] Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!
Pam, no, no. Holly’s coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it’s a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.
Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?
I would, but I don’t want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It’s just us.
I will help. Although my ‘brid’, my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won’t fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.
I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.
Oh, do you mean Darryl? That’s a great idea. I’ll ask him.
Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
I should come along, just ’cause he’s my, you know, he’s my hookup.
Come on, now, Justine, look… Listen, look, I’ve been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.
[on the phone] I’m not doing it! She told me she wants to have Christmas here.
Yes. She wants to be around family for Christmas.
I don’t know… I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
[Pam knocks on Darryl’s door] Don’t come in, I’m busy. [Pam opens the door]
Hey, sorry, I really didn’t want to come in. It’s just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we’re hoping we could borrow your truck.
Come on, it’ll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.
No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
Okay. Sorry. We’ll uh, we’ll leave you alone.
Hey… [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let’s do it.
When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.
I’ve looked her up online… there’s nothing about her. She’s made no impression on the internet.
She doesn’t need an internet presence, you just know.
What the hell are you doing here? You’re supposed to be in the courthouse.
Uh, we’re on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.
What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.
I can’t talk about it or I’ll get removed from the jury.
And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.
I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we’re just talking.
[standing outside, dials Dwight’s cell phone]
[voicemail recording] You’ve reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave… [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.]
I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.
[dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off]
Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing ’em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then… [reading text message] “How ’bout icing it? lol. Dwight.”
Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?
I’m really sorry, I can’t help you. I’m waiting for my boss’ pretty friend to arrive.
There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God’s sake?
[weak Clint Eastwood accent] Well, well, well, if it isn’t Michael Scott. You old bastard.
[imitating her accent] Well, I never thought I’d see your face around these parts, you old bastard.
Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.
[as Curly] Why, you’re some sorta wise guy, huh?
[as Marge] Oh, Homey. [they both laugh]
[in monster voice] Oh, huggy monster!
Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don’t wanna die! I don’t wanna die! I don’t wanna die! [both sigh] Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.
Did you bring us anything from Nashua?
Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.
To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
Oh, it’s so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It’s like a party for limousine drivers.
Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.
Oh, it’s fabulous. I love what you did.
Isn’t it wonderful? We love it here. Don’t you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. [in a stereotyped Mexican accent] I show you to your desk.
[in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they’re both loaded. [makes gun noises]
What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?
This is weird. I can’t believe you’re here. This feels like you never left. Doesn’t it?
Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! [the both chuckle] Oh, I love toy…
Well, that’s understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?
You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy’s mom.
Because without Andy’s mom, there’s no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.
That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn’t seen any of the Toy Story movies.
No. I know. I was like, “What? Are you serious?”
We sat down and we watched them all in one day.
Now he’s the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.
Really? That’s creepy. How did AJ get in your house?
He had a little note pinned to him that said, “You’ve got a friend in me.”
[fighting back tears] Yeah, Randy Newman’s the best.
[singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won’t you be my Christmas tree.
Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?
[on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh… pick a damn tree already.
Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it’s none of my business, but if I couldn’t have Cece for Christmas, I’d be really upset too.
I don’t have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I’m going to kill myself.
Jada don’t want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn’t as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.
Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that’s something to do.
No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
Bring her to the party. Yeah, we’ll have Santa, and we’ll play games with her. It’ll be a lot of fun.
You’ll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
Nobody hug me, I’m covered in tree sap, so…
Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I’m Santa Claus. Welcome.
No, he doesn’t. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.
Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.
Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
Well, you’re almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.
Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?
Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
You guys, I don’t think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.
Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly’s not in any position to be shooing guys away.
I don’t get it! I’m sorry. I just, I don’t get it!
Okay, listen, I’m gonna tell him that if he doesn’t propose by the end of this year, we’re over.
That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
[turns in Pam’s chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally]
Don’t. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]
Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
There’s no connection between the origin story and the quest.
We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it’s the bear’s quest.
Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?
Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
I mean, help, if it’s something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or…
Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It’s also a little derivative of a serias called ‘Bear Man’. Did you look that up?
There’s this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse…
I can’t reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]
I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don’t. And that’s just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. [clip of Michael throwing Holly’s Woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it]
Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car… for screwing Americans.
Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.
You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.
What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.
I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
What are you talking about? You’re the one terrorizing me.
With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
Dwight’s right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I’m really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.
All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? [he holds up a toy taxi cab] Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.
I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain’t Tara.
Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don’t think we can help you out.
No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.
[walks in with a dirty Woody] Who did this? It’s obvious to me I’m not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I’m leaving.
Well, I don’t think Erin seems to like you.
That’s not true. I don’t know her enough to make a decision even.
What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby’s very jealous of all the attention you’ve been getting.
No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.
Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn’t that nice? Thank you very much.
Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren’t looking. You don’t think… it’s not possible… that Woody did this to himself.
No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.
Why would anyone frame you for that?
Okay, I’m sorry, why are we discounting this whole “Woody came to life” thing so quickly?
Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?
[laughs] I don’t. But someday I think we will laugh about this… when we tell our kids…
Oh no, that’s, that’s not happening.
All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn’t mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.
Michael, you have to let this go. I’m with someone else. I don’t feel that way anymore.
Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That’s what Jim and Dwight thought.
No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.
You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I’d get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?
And we did this whole stupid party for you.
Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?
Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] “Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.” [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!
Didn’t think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.
So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?
I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for… that is the life.
Daddy, I’m bored. Can I read my book in your office?
Jada, Darryl, I’m so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?
I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.
Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?
No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?
Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he’ll tell us if we’re hot or cold.
The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she’s burning up because the star is right behind her ear! [pulls star from coat and pretends to find it behind Jada’s ear]
Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.
Senator, it’s an honor. I’m Angela’s friend Oscar.
Robert seems great. He’s very handsome, firm handshake, he’s gay, good sense of humor.
I’m, uh, I’m AJ. I’m here to see Holly. It’s kind of a surprise.
I know who you are, and I think you should go.
I bet you didn’t even bring us anything, did you?
Was I supposed to bring you guys something?
What are you doing here? Oh, my God.
Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.
What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies…
You have a whole room of vending machines?
[chuckles] I know. Isn’t it something?
[handing out vending machine items to everyone] Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas. And Merry Christmas.
[Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet!
[holding a knitted iPad case] It’s amazing. It’s so great. Thank you.
[Angela hands Creed a pack of deodorant] For me?
I don’t know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
I’m just so touched that she’s so interested in my work.
The real problem is the teachers’ union.
No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can’t read.
Hey, who’s in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans]
I’ll make it. What are you drinking.
An ‘F’ train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.
Okay, well, I’ll just stick with my mojito.
And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he’s helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they’ve really become a pest.
[Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don’t think he’s in the ceiling, babe.
Well, uh… I don’t think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]
Is it… is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it]
[lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.
Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn’t make that.
Oh, um, it’s just, I didn’t, I didn’t have a lot of time, so that’s just a place holder.
Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] “The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.” Oh, my God. This is awesome! That’s my bike. That’s my desk. And that is my daughter.
Oh, hey, hey, no, don’t run. You’re gonna slip.
Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.
[voice breaking] Yeah, well, at least he was married.
Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything’s gonna be okay.
No, it’s not. It’s not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.
I shouldn’t tell you this, but… AJ won’t commit to Holly. And she’s gonna tell him that if he doesn’t propose to her by the end of the year, it’s over.
Really. And I don’t know about you, but I don’t know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?
Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don’t want you to fall.
I do not accept your surrender. There’s only one way that I would ever relent.
You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.
Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You’re re-gifting this to me.
No, that’s not… no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.
Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt.
[hands Kelly a receipt from his wallet] From the mall. That…
This is a fast food receipt from April.
God, how many number nines did you order?
Oh, I think everyone’s on edge because of the strangler trial.
Hey, I’m so glad you came down. It’s been so much harder than I expected.
Oh, okay, get ready for this. You’re not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.
Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.
Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn’t he say that?
You, are you sure you don’t want a pony? You want a real horse?
All right. You have to pick up after them.
Oh… come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker]
Have you ever seen ’em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen]
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim!
In the end, the greatest snowball isn’t a snowball at all. It’s fear. Merry Christmas.
This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
I’m actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha… screw you!
Dwight, don’t be bothered by your friend’s presence.
What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader’s weird voice? Huh? [mimicking the leader’s voice] Dwight, don’t be bothered by the [mumbles]. Over the line, Jim.
I’m just looking for my phone, so… pretend I’m not here.
Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That’s our official name, Jim.
Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
And the rest was just [mumbles]stuff.
Go ahead and read it, some people weren’t here.
Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
[answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
[filming video] Michael, I know what you’re thinking. Holly’s engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it’s not.
[giggles] Snot.  Sorry, it sounded like you said it’s snot.  I am so sorry.
Okay, so killing yourself. [laughs] I was just thinking about snot.
Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year’s resolution on them, I’ll collect them, and then display them on… da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.
I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she’s awesome.
I know Sue. She’s not that great. And you know her husband’s in a wheelchair, right?
Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin.
Thank you! And two bottles of scotch.
I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly’s favorite. I hope she doesn’t call us up on stage. That would suck. “Hey, you think you can do my job better?” I don’t know. “What’s your name?” Michael.
I’m really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he’ll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
Oh, hey, guys! I’d like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Year’s resolution board.
So… high five me. We’re back. To a happy… [grabs Holly’s hand] look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?
They’re so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put ‘er there. Give me a good firm… ooh! That’s a good firm handshake. You’re hired! Yes, let’s get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away.
Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can’t keep those mittens on forever.
[Holly takes off mittens revealing no ring on her ring finger] Congratu-ohhh.
Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum.
[sticking both ring fingers up] Ha ha, ha ha!
Hey! [sticking up middle finger] Right back atcha, bitch!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, calm down, breathe.
Wait a second, are you listening to music?
Fine, just go crazy for a little while! Lookin’ good! You’re lookin’ good. [roping Michael in] Oh, I gotcha! I gotcha! I’m pulling you back! Michael dance off!
Oh my God! [sprays champagne on Erin]
Hey, Dwight, I’m collecting resolution cards.
I’ve achieved plenty and there’s no better than the best.
Drink less caffeine. That’s a good one, Pam. Here’s mine.
Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so…  two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one.
No, some people don’t just meet someone. I’m fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It’s not a party at all. It’s just sad.
Oh, you mean the state senator. I’m sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote ‘the senator’.
Wait, it’s that easy? That’s not a resolution, that’s just… something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that… [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is… meet a loose woman.
You know what, that’s my new one. I’m taking that one, too.
You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There’s tons of cuties and it’s easy to talk to them. ‘Hey, what book is that? Cool, let’s hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa…’
I’ll come with you, show you how it’s done.
My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
Hello! Oh, somebody’s got a new phone!
I got it for Christmas. I’m so out of my league here.
[imitating E.T.] E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?
[imitating E.T.] Holly misses old phone.
[imitating E.T.] New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception.
I still have my old phone. This thing… indestructible. [slams phone on desk, phone breaks]
[reaches for her cell phone] Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, don’t go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right.
Holly doesn’t seem to be engaged, but she’s talking to AJ like she is. I can’t figure it out. Do you think she’s already dating a different AJ?
When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?
No. She’d just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend. [disgusted voice] Oh, hi friend! Blegh.
That’s true. She’s really nice. She’d talk to anybody. Why don’t you bring Erin to balance you out?
All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.
I’ll take the entirety of the second floor.
I got that cutie behind the counter.
Well, if you read a lot, you should check out our e-readers. They’re really neat.
Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
Holy [bleep], what? Let me see that. It’s so light. Like a croissant.
Why did we pretend like we work here?
Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let’s roll.
No, that’s uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady… nasty… porn.
[whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?
Oh, really good, I went to Portugal.
So, I’ve just gotta know. What’s going on with you and AJ?
Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year’s deadline, but um, it came and went… and, we’re still together.
You didn’t break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
It just wasn’t fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we’re going to be just fine. Just fine.
I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
[Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
Come on, why not? I’ve never been in one before. I’m tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
I’m telling you, don’t do it. I’ve got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can’t unsee that.
Well, we can’t just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
Hey, there’s a roller rink across the street! There’s always chicks at the rink.
What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
I don’t know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties.
Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who’s been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
Cool! Here’s a little ‘way to go’ gift from Sabre. [tosses Erin a Frisbee]
Creed. I noticed you don’t have a resolution on the board. What’s yours?
I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel.
I’m having a little trouble motivating.
One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.
But that’s okay. Because it’s not about being perfect, it’s about trying.  In fact, why don’t we go around and confess some of the ways that we’ve fudged on some of our resolutions?
Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven’t yet. But it’s okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that’s fine.
Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I’ll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.
Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12:01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.
Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
What is wrong with you people? Can’t you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing’s stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!
You’re just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what’s going to be on your tombstone?  Loser.
My tombstone’s already made, thank you.
[holding broccoli in front of Kevin] Eat it.
I don’t know. I’m glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
I don’t care whether you hate it! You said you’d do it!
All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue. [reveals hidden broccoli, spits it out] Oh, God! You guys are pathetic.
Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there.
Oh, no, Michael, I don’t want to talk about it with you. I mean, I’m fine, I just… I don’t want to talk about it.
Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn’t be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies… I… care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.
Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.
You’re right. And I hope that we can still be friends.
[at the skating rink]Hey, uh. It’s just you. Anything you want to hear?
Um… Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only.
Okay. [Ants Go Marching starts playing]
I just feel blocked. Like I’m living, but I’m not…
That’s real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.
[holding a pack of cigarettes] Well, if you don’t have to do ’em…
Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
My resolution was to get more attention.
Hey, Ryan. [taps board, makes farting noise]
One, two, three. [does cartwheel] I did it! I did a cartwheel!
[throws resolution board away in dumpster] Lesson learned.
Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.
Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
So, that’s it, guys? If you want, I can put on the strobe.
My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it’s from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.
We’re gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine… just fine… just fine… just fine…
I just think we need to cool things down for awhile.  Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I’m sure.
Look at where you’re going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where you’re going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot.
You know what? I’m going to stay here as long as it takes.
What a rush! That’s all I had to do all year.
Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow.
You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that.
Oh no no, I’m not picking on you at all. You’re English, correct?
I’m working on an English character. Would you mind gi…  It’s called Reginald Pooftah.
Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?
Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He’s called Ho Li [bleep].  That’s what it sounds like.
You can’t do that these days. You can’t.
No, no, no. And people don’t understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.
No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That’s what she said. [laughs]. [hugs Michaels] Ohh.
Your first student is here, Mister Bernard.
That’s actually “Master of Ceremonies” Bernard.
Oh it’s… [points to conference room]
[enters] [in a gruff voice] Hello, I am here for the small business seminar.
Nein! I’m greek! My name is Mikanos.
Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.
Listen, this isn’t a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win.
Go higher. I get super flexible when I’m nervous.
Wow. [sees guy at Erin’s desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I’m really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can’t be apart of this seminar.
No. What? You can’t do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You’re the charming warm-up guy,
If the seminar was a meal, you’d be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night.
Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing’s over?
What’s going on? Do you know that guy?
I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
What are some of your small business ideas?
I was thinking we could buy up of abandoned mine shafts.
That’s great. There’s a big, big future in that.
My company would act as an intermedium, for like, point two cents off every transaction.
Something with cell phones. It’s like, every time you make a phone call I’d make point two cents. Or anything like any on-line shopping I would get point two cents.
You promised us whales. These are worms.
They’re not worms, Dwight, okay? They’re just people with tiny businesses. They’re baby whales which is even cuter.
What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We’re suppose to be a team.
We’re no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
You know what might be kind of fun?  I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and…
Oh, I don’t know, Michael. I’m not feeling up to that.
[as Mikanos] If-a you change-a you mind, why don’t you talk to Mikanos?
Is Mikanos greek? He sounds Italian.
Ugh. You’re the fifth person to tell me that today.
Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.
Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that.
[muttering] Down… there. [to Pam] Is “jlp” a word?
No, j-l-p. Like, “I jlp… I jlp you!”
I’m playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I’ve never won a game.
It means you’re playing someone who’s going to destroy you. Why did you play “moo”?
Because I’m playing to win. I’m playing “moo”, I’m playing “milk”. Whatever it takes.
Okay, but look, you could have hit “mood”. Would have played a…
No, it doesn’t have to just be cow stuff, right?
Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I’m just… I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy.
Andy, I’m no Jim. The only way that I’m Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
Hey, that’s crazy talk. I think you’re great.
Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?
I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business.
Okay. I don’t… I don’t like committing to things just like that.
No, I don’t like committing to not doing things, either. That’s just as big a commitment.
What do I put you down for, bro hombre?
Okay, than you so much. It’s going to be so awesome.
Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed:
Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog.
[running laps around the conference room] Yes!
There are some people who have charm and some people who don’t. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
[out of breath] Dream… big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c… an. [coughing] And then double it! [coughing].
I’m really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last…
But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
Who am I? I’m Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. “The Business Bitch”, “The Diet Bitch”, “The Shopping Bitch”, “The Etiquette Bitch.”
Hey, Kelly Kapoor. What a delicious surprise.
Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone.
Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
Um, there aren’t really ten secrets.
Um, all right. Well, um, I guess know your market would be key. Practice fiscal discipline.
A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that “q” right there.
Put the “q” there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled.
You could have just told us what you were thinking.
[as Mikanos] I like the musical “Grease”, or as we call it, “home”.
We have to try this out on somebody.
[with accent] It’s a very strong coffee with milk from a goat.
[laughs] I can’t believe-ee. It’s a miracle. She can talk!
Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is… Creed Bratton. [applause]
Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a penis. I have just described to you the Loch Ness Monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question:
[clapping] Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We’ll meet back up in an hour.
I picked out our movie. It’s called “Suspiria”. It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down.
We’re gonna watch “Wall-e”, where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some “Slumdog Millionaire” scenario, where every word she’s playing has a connection to her orphan past. It’s possible.
So what’s your crazy business pipe dream?
Well, I started my own golf supply company.
It’s taken off faster than I expected, so I came here to learn about creating manageable growth.
Hey, friend. How’s it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
Hey, you know what? Good news. We’re back in. Let’s go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?
[turning towards Darryl] Hey, do you need a lozenge?
[whispering] They’re a bunch of jackals.
They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you’re almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. [to Michael and Holly] Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What’s goin’ on?
Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.
Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes.
[pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have “apoplexy” if you lose. Do you understand? “Apoplexy” is what I will have.
Got it. [plays word] Oh, Oscar. Oscar?
[on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don’t think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so…
[as Mikanos] Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I’m going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it’s a secret, and I’ll tell you. [exits conference room] [normal voice] All, you have to close right now.
No, you’re not. You’re getting past it. You have to close. You can do it.
This is hard for me. I’m a nice guy.
Psst. You think this thing’s gonna go much longer?
I don’t know. They’re still in there.
Here’s the story. That guy in there is Jim’s childhood friend, Tom.
Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.
I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
And Jim’s mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.
“My mom thinks you’re too dumb to hang out with.”
Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? [younger guy raises hand] Sold! Anybody else? [older guy raises hand] Yes! All right!
Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life.
But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you’ve got my information, so feel free to call anytime.
Hey, you think it’s cool if I grab a soda?
Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
Must be a front for some kind of famous laboratory. [laughs]
Oh, barely. I’m so dumb, you know, stuff goes in, stuff goes out. Not like you probably remember every paper sale you ever made. Paper salesman genius.
Andy. I didn’t think you had it in ya.
Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They’re on the outside. Don’t how you missed ’em.
[as Mikanos] Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on.
What? Come on. It’s time for grapes. [regular voice] Real fun day.
Well, that’s actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch “Wall-e”.
So I got us a compromise. This movie’s called “Hardware”. It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It’s some of what you like and some of what I like, and… married…
Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you’d really like it.
Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. [throws ring on the ground]
Just so you know, it’s totally amicable. We’re fine. We don’t need people here to take sides.
The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
Wait. Can you back up? What’s the story?
We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.
And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said…
I don’t think I should be married to you anymore.
Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.
We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
God baby, you know, people’s reactions to this… maybe we made a mistake.
No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don’t want to be married until everyone can be married.
You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we’re ok with it. We agree it’s fine if you got married.
No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!
Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn’t amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?
And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand]
Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?
Don’t you have a sales call to go on?
I don’t understand. I really don’t. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?
Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
Michael, I can’t keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I’m working with. Well, you can understand that.
Yeah, I understand. I just don’t agree.
I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.
He’s going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
Aw you’ll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny “Jim” game.
That’s it? That’s all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you’re really getting warmer.
Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
You know what, just think about it, you’ll be fine.
Just drive faster. I want to get back.
Well, I’m going the speed limit. So…
Okay, fine. My feelings don’t matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit.
No I’m not. I’m not in a bad mood. I’m not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let’s just talk about you, as always. Is sex different after the baby, Jim?
Alright. Well we’ll be there in ten minutes.
What part of “I need to pee” do you not understand? I’m upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.
Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I’ll pull over.
Everything is fine. Baby’s fine. She has a tiny fever. I’m taking her for a check up. Nothing to worry about.
A tiny thing. I locked her in the car.
[towards bathroom] Hello? [gives up and drives off]
Hey it’s me. So uh, don’t worry. Everything’s ok.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You’re not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
No no no it’s ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She’s laughing and she’s happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here’s the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.
And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a “Ask Pam Beasley”. … Did the phone cut off?
Alright, just call me after the doctor.
I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn’t here and I am worried that he has been abducted.
No, he ditched you man. I saw him drive away.
There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. He’s my… Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please!
Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick. [opens phone] And you don’t have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?
You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim’s number.
He left you here on purpose. All right? I saw it. He just drove away.
Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good. [to cameras] Nope, get away. No, that’s enough. Ok.
It’s the gas station on Benet Street?
You know what? Why don’t you stay and I’ll go?
It’s kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I’m going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.
Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I’m not even kidding. They’re pretty good.
Well the first one has a surprise factor. “I’m a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!”
But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.
“I’m suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.”
You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.
I’ve been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason:
Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.
Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.
Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type:
He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.
Oh really? You don’t think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
Alright. Don’t get a swelled head. You’re no tracker.  [Dwight and Erin low-five] Let’s ride.
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought…
This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it’s convent, I just thought since you are out…
Pam, I’m obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
Ok, well it wasn’t obvious so… [phone hangs up]
Ok, it’s two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.
Ok, I’m sorry but I am going to have to shut this down.
Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It’s either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed.
Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.
Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for.
I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don’t get the reference, making them feel like the other.
Ok final thing, and this is a fun one:
Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. [laughs] Not every day.
Pam, I think I’m going to send you an IM.
Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I don’t have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog.
Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.
I can’t just go giving away hot dogs.
All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don’t sell?
Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don’t you just throw one away now into my mouth?
There’s too many brands. Where’s Holly?
Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go.  I’ll take my free stress ball too now.
Sure thing. Here you go, Miss… Okay, Fanny Smellmore. Real original.
You know what? Say hi to Orville Tootenbacher for me.
Orville Tootenbacher. That’s Michael’s millionaire character that…
Of course. He was here. She’s the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?
Are their egg rolls really that big?
Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?
Okay. I’ll be right back. [goes to leave but walks back]. Okay. You know what? I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I don’t have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can’t do that to you fine people.
Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
You did not. You have no money. And you dined so much.
Well the number three is not such a giant feast.
You were trying to steal food from us?
I am not. I just have had a bad day.  And I… okay. I’ll be back later with the money. I’m just gonna leave right now.
Well, I think I can get through the door.
Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian…
What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What… what are you implying?
Uncanny. Put a pin in that. [to waiter] Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. [pointing] This way, this way, this way? I don’t know. Do you know?
Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive.
You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You’re a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter]
Woman, you’ve had a computer for years!
Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I’ll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don’t want to be your babysitter.
“Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat.” [laughter]
No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn’t even include the fact that they’re dogs.
“Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you’re dreaming you’re a dog on a desert island.’
Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?
Well, if you think it’s so easy, Gabe, why don’t you try it?
Umm… “You don’t have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I’m the only one here.” Ha.
More tasteless than this…”is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let’s pee on it.”  [laughter]
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.
Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that’s chirping to you, “this way, this way”?
Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we’re coming for you!
Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that’s all.
All right then. Someone propose a plan.
Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let’s just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below.
That is the stupidest idea I’ve ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
Look, I’m not playing. I’m gonna go look for him.
Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right… I’m deep below the ocean’s surface in a submarine. A torpedo’s coming right at me. No. Damn it, that’s just my own imagination.  Maybe he’s bowling.
[walks to the roof of a building and spots Michael] Michael?
Hi. [laughs] How did you know I was up here?
I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.
Yeah. [laughs] Wow. I just miss you so much.
Maybe that’s not the best one. Keep reading.
“Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe.”
No, that’s not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
“I know what it smells like but I didn’t roll in anything. It’s from listening to all of Gabe’s bull[bleep]. [laughter] “Isn’t this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I’m Gabe and I’m a weirdo.”
“Gabe’s mom… hmm… Gabe’s mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her.”
At least she lived a very long and I’m sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you’re ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we’re thinking about you.
Thank you. “Congratulations, Darryl. Let’s get wasted.” “Have fun today, big guy.” “Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.”
It’s possible that some people thought it was your birthday.
“Hooray. Live it up big D. ” “Days like this don’t come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this”?
Birthday punches! [softly punching Darryl in the stomach] One two three four five sice seven eight!
…thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!…
…So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I’m taking Rachel. She’s picking me up after work.
Nice. Do the damn thing. – Pow! [they fist bump and explode]
Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won’t do it, but they will if you make a scene.
Okay, bye. Okay, bye. [kisses Michael] I’ll miss you.
Miss you. Okay. I’ll be in my office if you need me.
Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye… bye.
Don’t go. I don’t want you to go. Oh don’t go. Don’t go.
Holly and I are dating. It’s been a week, and I still can’t believe it. [sighs] It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can’t work for it. It just comes to you.
I dominate Valentine’s Day. I practically make romance into a science.
“Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue.” Oh, my gosh. It’s a romantic scavenger hunt!
Oh, close. It’s a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck.
[rubbing hands with Holly] Are these numbers correct?
Are you… are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? ‘Cause you’re grossing me out.
[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.
I’m missing my scarf. Oh. [both laugh]
We decided to have a Valentine’s day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine’s day dinner thing. It’s a whole thing.
Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue… station. And what else was there?
Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?
Are you kidding me? It’s all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.
But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably…
Oh! No, no, no, no. It’s not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.
D…d…d…d…don’t look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy]
[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]
Okay, my name is j…j…j…j…j…j…j…j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you… under you. I’ll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p…p…p…p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn’t really. [clears throat]
[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.
You’re just filling that out right now. That wasn’t meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.
I don’t know if anyone else feels this way and don’t get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I’m being overly sensitive, but… the PDA.
Thank you! I mean, I’m thrilled for them.
No one is more thrilled for them than I am…
I don’t know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because…
Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying…I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
So tell me about your new girlfriend.
She’s neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl’s cousin’s party. We were the only two white people there.
That’s Gabe’s boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
[to Toby] I hear them kissing all the time. It’s this horrible plipping sound. You know, it’s like Chinese water torture. Just…[makes popping sound] like it’s coming from my own head.
Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly’s back]
I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He’s a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head.
Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice.
[sitting in Holly’s lap] Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?
Seeing as it’s Valentine’s Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace.
Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.
First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you’d expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances.
Speaking of, Gabe, I don’t see Erin at this meeting.
I get it. Andy’s slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam.
They don’t touch. They don’t kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife.
Okay. So, PDAs. That’s gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh…
Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking.
The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap…
Sure. Basically, there’s no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem.
What, are you talking about me and Holly?
Yeah, and it’s not just the kissing. It’s the flirtatious whispering.
Whispering and tickling have their place in business.
That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
I… Okay, yeah, that’s pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.
As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.
You win. But here’s what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
Michael, that’s absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?
Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we’re gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?
And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
No, no, it’s great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.
That’s weird. I mean, that’s weird to have sex in the office. That’s where you work, right?
You know, you’re in a meeting, and nobody knows that you’ve had sex there, except for you and him.
[softy] We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.
[softly] Not if we’re talking like this. I think it’s okay. He doesn’t seem to hear us.
[softly] That makes sense, ’cause I feel like I’d be able to hear us at this level.
No, I’m just testing if he can hear.
Okay. Then no more talking. Let’s just play the song.
[Gabe singing] The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night.
You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.
Ah, the old “leave behind.” Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it’s working.
Oh, no. Michael, I don’t want to make people uncomfortable.
Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don’t… I don’t sit on your lap because it’s comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.
Yeah, but if they’re uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.
Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we’ll stop.
Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.
Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine’s Day.
Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We’ve only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, “oh, hey, there’s Holly. I love that girl.” Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?
Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. [both laugh]
I am really disappointed in the office’s policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. [shakes Holly’s hand]
Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me.
Okay, Ryan’s the temp. What does he do at night?
I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
Oh, or maybe not. [turns out the lights]
Yeah. Did you not see it? [“Eat at Hanks” is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door]
[bursting out of Ryan’s closet] Hey.
Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he’s not here.
Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.
You wanted to have sex in my office.
No. It’s… it’s cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you’re finished. I’ll be out here.
That was so embarrassing. I’m gonna die.
Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.
No, because the office isn’t what I’d consider a romantic place.
Besides, we have something those other people don’t have, which is a home and a bed.
No touching. Ah, I’m trying not to touch you.
Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can’t do that. We can’t do this. Ohh.
I don’t know what your body feels like ’cause I can’t touch it.
Okay, this is much worse than before.
I will grab you here anyway. [laughs]
I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can’t stop. You don’t what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.
No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it’s reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One:
Give me all your money and take off your clothes.
Come one. Nobody’s looking. What’s wrong?
I haven’t thought about you having to go back to Nashua.
Maybe we didn’t want to think about it. We can make it work. We’ll date long-distance.
That’s what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How’s this gonna be any different?
I’m not saying it won’t be hard. But we can make it work. That’s what she said.
Here’s your bottle of sparkling cider.
I’m now supposed to tell you to enjoy a mind-hunt break and look for a heart or some [bleep] in the break room when you’re through.
[through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy!
Hey. Hey. Come on. You’re hurting him.
…is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging.
[into recorder] Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.
No. [into recorder] Saving the world has never been this hard.
Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.
No, I can’t talk to her. I can’t even look at her without thinking about it ending.
Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.
Don’t do the squirrel. Throw your poop.
Maybe it’s just more like, “be mine.”
Oh, yes. There’s a note. “A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine’s kiss.”
Mm. Oh. We’re suppose to…mmm [leans in to kiss Andy]
Hmm. [points to Gabe blowing a kiss to Erin]
Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up.
Actually, it’s Valentine’s Day. Shouldn’t be doing this today. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.
No, we’re gonna talk now. You’re not breaking up with me.
You’re gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can’t handle it. So let’s just…let’s…
What if I said it wasn’t up to them?
The company. Nobody knows our future, but it’s not gonna be decided by the company. It’s not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me.
Are you kidding? I wasn’t trying to break you guys up.
Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss]
My perfect Valentine’s Day? I’m at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.
Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me…
Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.
What are our plans for tonight? Umm…
I’m supposed to deliver this one in person. [pulls out a gun and starts shooting at Michael, who dodges dramatically]
[pulls out two handguns and kills the man with an unnecessarily large amount of bullets] Clean up on aisle five. [Threat Level:
After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level:
Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody’s dying to see it.
That’s… That’s. Well, don’t put words in my mouth.
We’re all in it, from like years and years ago. It’s like a home movie.
Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
Okay everyone, I know we’re really excited to see this movie that everybody’s in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let’s stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we’ll have a pure fun day! Okay?
Mhmm! It’s got action, it’s got heart, it’s got some bosom.
[Dwight Schrute dressed as a butler. Speaks in slow, deep voice] Master Scarn.
I play Samuel, Michael Scarn’s robot butler. I wanted Samuel’s voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
[lying on bed with a bottle of alcohol] I’m up.
It’s the president. He needs you for a mission.
[Darryl, sitting at a desk in the Oval Office] Scarn, you’re right on time. [cheering from the office]
I gave up a lot of weekends because I thought it’d be good for my daughter to see a black man as president. Even in a silly home movie. What a stupid waste of time.
It’s your old enemy, Goldenface. He’s after the NHL All Star Game. He’s hidden a bomb somewhere in the stadium. Scarn, this one is personal for me. I own the stadium. I can’t see it blown up. It’s my retirement plan.
Not so fast, Goldenface has taken all the concession stand workers hostage. Scarn, will you find these hostages, and save the game?
[as a hostage] Don’t you guys get it? Nobody’s coming for us.
I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
[Creed wearing a tunic and carrying a mop, standing with Michael in front of an ice rink] Mop the ice.
I’m not here to learn how to mop, I’m here to learn how to play hockey.
Mop it. [A montage of Michael mopping the ice awkwardly and using an ab-cruncher, and slowly getting better. After a little while, Cherokee Jack Slams a hockey stick on the ice to stop Michael, then offers it to him] Now take this.
Mop. [a montage shows Michael sliding around the ice skillfully and hitting the puck into the goal]
Well, Michael Scarn was quickly becoming one of the hottest hockey players in the country.
Die! [The masked man pulls off the mask to reveal that it is Goldenface]
[Michael and Goldenface skate around the rink, Goldenface shooting with a solid gold gun, Michael with two pistols. Michael is out of breath at the end of the race] Nice try Goldenface, but you forgot one thing, to kill me.
I wasn’t trying to kill you, I was trying to slow you down. [Ryan is seen placing a medal around Oscar’s neck]
[begins to cry as Goldenface laughs]
Hey, you came in second. Not bad either.
I am sorry that I have to do this… [starts choking Oscar to death with his towel]
Huh…[muffled screaming as he slowly chokes, and eventually dies]
I’m intercepting a name. Jasmine Winsong. She works for Goldenface. What I can’t figure out is, who is the Funky Cat.
Not who, what. The Funky Cat is the hippest Jazz Club in town. [stands up with his cup of tea and walks by Samuel, pouring his tea all over him]
Oh-[starts to freak out, but the scene is crudely cut short]
He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
[acting as a jazz singer at the Funky Cat, singing] They call me Jasmine Winsong.
He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that’s great. Yeah that’s good for him.
[singing gibberish while laying on the piano on stage]
[pulls out a recording device from his pocket and clicks it on]
[michael pushes the backwards button on the recorder] The hostages are under the stadium. [An assassin with a golden tie shoots her with a tranquilizer and she falls]
You have to let us go Goldenface! We have families!
Ha! This is gonna show them [cocks his golden gun] that I mean business. See ya! [points gun to Toby the hostage’s head, shoots and Toby’s fake head explodes, the shot is shown repeatedly]
By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.
Ha! [kicking open the gate in the stadium where the hostages and Goldenface are]
The joke’s on you Goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist.
We’ve searched the whole building, Goldenface, where is the bomb?
We’ve searched the whole building, Goldenface, where is the bomb?
In the puck! [tosses the puck to Michael]
Because I’m going to kill you. [takes out golden gun] Unless! You forgive me for murdering your wife. [distraught, memories of him and his wife are shown on the puck in a dreamy haze]
[dodges the puck and shoots at Michael]
Noooo! [jumps in front of Michael to receive the bullet]
[re-cocks gun and shoots at Michael, who looks shocked and scared]
[as a busty nurse] You’ve already had four.
Looking at her mother on screen, horrified] Oh God… [looks at Michael] So good.
It’ll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill Michael Scarn.
Let’s just make sure that everything’s… Working properly… [leans in closer to Michael and the heart rate monitor, which was beating steadily, now beats very quickly]
You just said the bomb… is in the puck?
Is that where you hid the bomb Goldenface?
[walks into the Oval Office with an accomplice, Troy]
But why would you blow up the stadium? You OWN the stadium!
Where had I gone wrong? All I wanted was to start a family with my beautiful wife. But somewhere along the way, things got messed up.
It wasn’t easy for Scarn to admit that he had lost his self-confidence. And he hadn’t of course, He just wasn’t using it right now.
[Andy as a bar tender with  a Brooklyn accent] You don’t looks so good, what’s got ya down?
You got problems?! My TV don’t work! I pay thirty bucks a month for the damn satellite what’s-a-whosit, I can’t even get the damn game! Now you tell me, what’s worse than that?
[laughs to himself] Don’t ever change Billy. Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL All Star Game tomorrow.
I see what you mean about problems. I know what’ll cheer you up. That table of bachelorettes over there bought you this drink. [a table with Meredith, Phyllis, Karen, and Angela all say hey to Michael]
Ever banged an entire bachelorette party, baby? [winks]
Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?
I’m too depressed to save the big game Billy.
I’m gonna cheer you up, the only ways I know hows. [to a small boy in overalls] Hey kid! Hit G-9 on the Jukebox!
No Billy, I haven’t done that dance since my wife died.
There is a whole crowd of people out there, who need to learn, how to do The Scarn.
[as a drunken man in the bar] If doing The Scarn is gay, then I’m the biggest queer on Earth!
[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
[turns off the movie from the remote, the office complains]
I’m sorry, I’m really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
It’s like one of the best movies I’ve ever seen in my life.
[to Holly] Well that’s a… pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?
Okay. [Stands up and leaves the conference room to the dismay of the office] No, it’s not good enough. It’s not good enough…
Some people are really popping on screen!
Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it’s great!
Did you? What did you love about it?
Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn’t that great when you can all work together like that?
No, no. Holly, this isn’t Ocean’s Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don’t care about how it turns out. What’d you really think, honestly.
Is it, is it because you’re afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you… to keep me grounded.
[angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don’t think it’s great than you’re basically saying that you don’t believe in my dream.
Wha- It’s your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could’ve been working on the Scarn Nebulus.
Well why do you have to make a movie at all?
Because, if I don’t have this, what do I have? I have nothing.
Really, you can’t think of anything else that you might have?
I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
Yeah, you’re a real pain in the ass. And I’m gonna go watch the movie with people who think it’s great! And I’m sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I’m angry, and I love you.
Michael! You have to get to that puck before halftime! Or the whole stadium will explode!
I know, it’s a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on!
[crying] This one’s for you Cherokee Jack. [Michael skates into the rink of an already in-play match]
We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.
[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That’s fine, it’s great!
I worked in a gold factory, we had a boss, who only cared about money…
No it’s not. [kisses Holly while smiling] It’s not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.
[ees Cherokee Jack from a confusion of heavenly light and smoke] Cherokee Jack.
I want you to take all of your frustrations, with women, the system, with everything. Take it out on the puck. All on the puck.
[skates forward, hits the puck, and stares in wonder as it flies by]
Yah! [kicks open the gate to save the hostages, hostages rejoice as Samuel unties them] [the puck is seen flying into space and it hits a satellite, Billy is at his bar and his TV suddenly turns back on]
Hey! We got sports games again! [people at the bar cheer]
[seen at his house counting his money] Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! [The puck lands on his lap] Oh-[A large explosion blocks out his words] [The office cheers at the ending of the movie, Michael Scarn holds up a trophy]
[in Scarn manor] Some breakfast for me [shows a plate of bacon and eggs] and some breakfast for you. [pulls out an oil can and oils Samuel’s circuit board on his back]
Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.
[phone rings] I’ll get it! Man I love being retired! Scarn here!
[on phone] Michael, it’s the president.
Ugh… [after a little thought] I’m in.
[the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn’t the president evil?
No no, he’s doing it to catch the president!
No, no Dwight. He’s just being stupid. [the office laughs]
They’re still good for another week.
You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]
I’ve got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh]
Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord’s gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It’s just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.
Okay now really think hard about this one:
I can see that as a very real possibility.
[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?
Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That’s just…
I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women’s houses.
All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over!
It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who’s here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.
[walks into conference room with Michael and Todd] Hi!
[shaking Holly’s hand] Whoa! I’m sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston!
[laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let’s get started.
Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he’s at his funniest when you’ve given him five shots.
And it also helps if you’ve had five shots.
[peering into conference room] Don’t know, don’t care.
[to Todd] Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.
It’s great to be among friends, but until then, you suckers will do!
You did! You got burned, because Packer’s back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he’s probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
[seething] Holly, you approved this?
Yes I did, I think Todd’s gonna make a great addition to the staff.
What don’t you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don’t know what the word approved means.
I have very little patience for stupidity.
[walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we’re late. Gabe fell in the shower.
Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. [realizing there’s a new computer at her desk. Gets very excited] Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don’t wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?
Awwh, you’re welcome. [they hug] My pleasure.
[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?
I just helped someone out. It feels good.
Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so…
Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.
And I don’t have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit… And we can’t just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
Well there’s a lot of seats in the annex.
So you wouldn’t mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. [Jim looks appalled]
I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name’s carved under the desk.
[Grunting as he crawls under Dwight’s desk. Dwight follows] Let’s look at this.
Don’t be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.
[grunting while humping Michael and Dwight] Don’t even watch, Halpert!
[in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who’s dirt box is this?
What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]
[walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um…
Don’t what’s up us! You think you’re so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
Michael’s recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he’s been nothing but nice to me!
That’s how he gets you to take off his panties.
[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?
Okay, look. We can’t fire someone because we don’t like him.
Right this isn’t the U.S. Government.
[seems unsure] Everything… Everything.
Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he’s done?
Well if that’s the case, I guess I’ve gotta be fired too. [all groan in disgust]
Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! [pats her new computer]
This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! [to Pam, in a fake British accent] Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?
Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So…
Ok, but listen. We just don’t have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.
Well Andy’s desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it’s just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but…
Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.
So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
If you’re just handing them out, I want one too.
Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.
See, this is what I’m talking about.
What are you gonna play mange on faster?
Hey what’s going on you guys? [walking into the kitchen with Holly, Dwight, and Kevin, with whom he fist bumps] Yeahh! Three muska-queers!
So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
I don’t know, I love her and all, but she turned into a bitch. Mostly she’s great, but some days she acts like her mom. [Holly is un-amused]
Well, some girls go through a phase.
Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
Since when did you learn how to read?
[Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He’s right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
Kevin, in sumo culture, you’d be considered a promising up and comer.
[walking through the office, notices Andy with Erin’s computer set up at his desk] What the heck! Why do you have Erin’s computer!
It’s crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.
[nods] I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
Erin, it’s not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It’s not yours to give away.
Pam, when I’m freaking out, I just sorta step back and-
-take a few breaths, and then I ask myself:
Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?
That’s interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.
Fine! [the office goes back to their work] Please make sure no one is humping me!
[to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you’re going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.
So much happening. [not as excited as Michael]
Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
Yeah, You love him right? [Holly seems unsure] You love him. I can tell.
[looking anxious] If you’re not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he’s funnier than you? Oh honey…
So I’m less funny than not funny at all?
[very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
No, what I’m saying is, he’s not funny, but you’re funnier than he is.
[getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete’s sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex]
[to Jim] So you two are married to each other now, right?
[walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
‘Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I’m cool. You’re the new guy. It’s cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
That’s a lot of reasons! [suspicious]
I think I’ll pass. The only hot chocolate I’m into is Viva A Fox. [winks]
[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?
Well, you know you can’t actually poison him.
It wasn’t poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
I really think we should join forces on this one.
What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
You’ve gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can’t get to them.
[mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn’t annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
Okay! Well this isn’t my best, but call Froggy101, say that we’re the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we’re giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it’s his own number.
Why don’t you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
Absolutely, I’ll e-mail you a hundred.
Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I’ll read it over.
I don’t know if there’s really a private place in this office.
Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we’re a little late.
Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-
Mind if I close the door? [after shutting door in the conference room] What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.
Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?
You humiliated me in front of every body!
Okay, well I didn’t think about it like that. It’s just, I can’t do anything about it. I can’t replace that one unless that computer breaks.
Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.
[looks at her knowingly] Pretty sneaky sis. [knocking on conference room door]
[walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
[to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]
They’re all good. So good! Number three:
One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
Eat a brog. Maybe it’s because I didn’t understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
[at Hank’s with Michael, talking to Hank] And a ’76 that’s good to boot, I like that. [Hank smiles]
And you made Hank smile, that doesn’t happen often. You’re very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. [Hank looks irritated again]
I don’t know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
She was laughing hysterically that whole time!
I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
She asked me, Michael! It would’ve been rude not to answer.
You’ve been on the road a long time. And you’ve been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can’t be peeing all over the walls.
Michael, can I open the kamomo with you. I’ve been on the road too long. But, I wanna connect with my daughter. And it’s not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers.
You’re right. I gotta watch my behavior.
[Michael and Todd are walking into the office] Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.
I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
That’s silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn’t be apologizing to Packer. That doesn’t make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
I’m sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier.
Well, like I said, I wasn’t offended, but I’ll stand here for the big show.
Don’t do it Kevin, that’s the fake kind of apology.
This is textbook. It’s so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it’s some offense to have feelings. Don’t do it Kevin.
[muttering] Sometimes you over react.
Michael how’s this supposed to work? Packer’s gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he’s just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we’re back to square one.
Okay. You want an apology? Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius.
I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we’re through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
[in a car with Andy, by the dumpster you can see a new computer box] So listen, we have to really scuff this up.
No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I’m gonna make myself cry.
[watching Pam scrap his computer] That’s probably good. That’s enough.
It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo’s kept her eye on you!
[also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here’s the best part. I’m a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also I’m a huge boob nerd.
Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we’ll get ya’ back!
[trying to hide from Michael what they’re doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]
I cannot believe this, you’re sending Packer to Florida? Why?
Okay, so you’re tricking him into flying to Florida?
It wasn’t my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we’re doing.
He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
Wait! Why don’t we come up with a plan we’re all happy about? [Michael leaves]
[plugging in new computer, acting to make people think he got a bad computer] Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?
Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
Where’d you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?
Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]
All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it]
[walking into Michael’s office] You’re looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the “ass”, in Tallahassee!
Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight!
Well… I don’t know if that’s a good idea.
Listen, I’m gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It’s your girlfriend, man. She’s uptight.
I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I’m saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I’ll introduce you to all the local [spanks the air] talent.
That is. [Jim sees them and looks happy] It’s gonna be awesome. I think you’re really going to enjoy it down there.
[kisses her and speaks normally again] You ahh.
So this new computer you found in the warehouse.
Yeah, you really did. ‘Cause I know every INCH of that warehouse.
Maybe you could go back down there and see if you can find me some extra sick days.
[hesitating at the bribe] Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
Really? ‘Cause I think maybe I saw five.
Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn’t need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.
People! Look alive. It’s showtime. Doors open in 3…2…1.
It’s cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
It’s good that its cold it will drive business inside.
Uh oh, looks like someone’s sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?
Schrute’s are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
I will trade you for the used candle.
Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
Woah, I love her. How much for that?
I uh… I actually don’t know why I brought that because It’s kind of priceless.
Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that.
You know we don’t have to sell that if you don’t want to. If it’s a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.
You know it’s really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
Well we could put it in storage… in case.
You know… in case if something changes.
I don’t have an in case. Do you have an in case?
Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You’re blocking my table with your giant body.
Oh, cause there’s a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
Screw you man. People like my stuff.
People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you’re like ‘Hey baby let me light a candle’ then you pull out this one half used and he’s like ‘Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.’
You can take my Helen Fielding collection.
Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game?
Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii… I was in heaven.
It’s Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
Professor Copperfield’s Miracle Legumes?
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he’s selling these. Dwight he’s telling me things about myself that there’s no way he could have known.
Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
So you wanna sell me magic beans. [laughs]
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield’s Miracle Legumes.
Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.
Your friend Michael, yes. What’s going on?
Um, I think I know. But I’ll sound stupid if I’m wrong but is Dad there?
There was a program on TV about India.
Um, ok. Did you connect with Michael?
I… I’m not there Dad, I’m in Pennsylvania.
I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?
Mom, Dad can’t seem to focus on a subject.
Don’t you worry about him, he’s got me.
I have your father. He’s right here I’ll put him on.
[looks out window] Michael! Michael!
Hi..  I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I’m gonna run out of gas.
Is it a good message or a bad message?
I’m asking Holly a question in fire.
Hey you know what? I’ve got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?
Michael, you’ve had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.
I am not in the mood for riddles pam.
You know what? I’m gonna get a hose. Then we’ll talk about it. Ok we’ll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
No I meant like uh, it’s cool, its kosher, it’s all good.
Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [laughs]
Oh, its just Stanley’s old photo album. I’m thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I’m not James Franco.
things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith’s junk for Kelly’s crap for Phyllis’ garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley’s garbage for Ryan’s junk for Creed’s garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
[pulls away beans] I’m really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
They’re legumes Dwight, and you’re just gonna make fun of me, so why would I… You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]
Hey Michael everyone’s in the conference room.
Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about… recycling.
I could not have agreed with you more.
And I’ve always believed that we should all be involved in everyone’s personal lives, in a very major way.
No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can’t talk me out of it.
She’s amazing. This is very exciting.
So we just… we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it’s safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
I had a great idea until you ruined it.
Wanna know how to do it? Here’s how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
[playing the Dallas board game] Hmm, I’m gonna play me a little ol’ black mail card .
And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.
No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
Why not. Seems to me we’re just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.
And I’m gonna play this here share the wealth card.
Which entitles me to half of both of y’alls money so if you don’t mind.
no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.
What… Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]
It didn’t go down so easy but she’s made some friends and it’s already better than it was.
Uh I don’t know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says ‘I cant take care of myself anymore’ its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you’re interested.
Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn’t you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ‘ I lost my head when I fell in love with you.’
It’s easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.
Don’t think you need the corpse then.
No she’s going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
That mush have been a surprise when… at the gas station you proposed.
No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
Oh yea you didn’t say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
I know but I’m still scared I don’t know why.
Cause it’s a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
Get this… Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him ‘Dude this was a prop in my movie.’
Ok it’s because we haven’t sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they’re gonna pay anything.
I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn’t doing so well.
Yeah, yeah it’s just you know I don’t want to go home when he’s on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he’s still my dad.
Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
And I want you to come with me. Now I know that’s a lot to ask of a boyfriend..
And I was thinking… you know maybe since given our last conversation that we’re both ready… Michael Scott will you..
No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.
No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.
You cant go, you’re dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.
Yeah I told you, you can’t shoot people.
I told you we’re way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
This is stupid and I want my money back. Where’s the money?
Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
I know right…[sees Jim’s beans] what the?
It is right. I mean, it’s impossible.
I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn’t the telescope at all. No, it was this… packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
That’s great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.
No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.
It was wrong to put you in that position and… Michael you are my life now. I’m not going to Colorado.
Shhhh. Let’s go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
So this is one of my favorite places in the world.
This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let’s go in here.
And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
Right in here… this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?
We saved a lot of lives that day. That’s where you first met Michael Klump.
Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!
And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn’t believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I’d do. [runs water through hand]
[everyone in the office is standing in the kitchen with a lit candle] Hi guys.
This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
That guy’s got more than he can handle as it is.
That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
Only one that I was kind of worried about.
[the area where Holly’s desk is is filled with lit candles] This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with.. [fire sprinklers go on] Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?
Your wife becoming me will I. [everyone in the kitchen starts cheering, then enters annex]
Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We’re moving to Colorado.
Holly has to go back to Colorado. I’m going with her. I’m leaving.
Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I’m a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
I’ll drink to that. I’m starting at a company this week.
And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.
Do not tell my fiance I’m drinking on a Wednesday.
I’m moving out to the burbs… actually, I’m moving further than the burbs, I’m moving to Colorado.
No, no. I don’t want to end up like Sunny Bobo.
Well that’s just good sense right there. Everyone I know who skis is dead.
You know, I would like to try the luge, through.
Try it once, you’re hooked. That’s my guess.
[holds out fist] Knuckles! Actually, I gotta come around and give you…
You know, it’s funny, I tried to get an animal olympics going.
You know, life happened. What are you gonna miss most about Scranton?
Oh… wow. The mountains. Where things are.
Man, he is late. I’m gonna call him. Do you mind? I’m sorry. [calls Deangelo, Deangelo’s phone vibrates]
No, I’m here. I’m right… I’m at the bar.
I’m at the bar. The bar that’s located in the lobby of the hotel.
I’m been here about… gosh, over half an hour.
[looking up from phones in unison] Sorry…
I hear your voice, I see your lips moving.
I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man! [holds out hand] Michael Scott.
That is insane, that is the right term. Let’s get some Vodka up in this cranberry, and one for my friend.
[entering Dunder Mifflin offices] Here we go! Are you ready?
I am very much looking forward to tommorow. It feels like the culmanation of a lot of hard work, a lot of good fortune…
[pops up from below camera, and runs out of room]
Did that? Did that just happen?! [runs after Michael] We should.. we should write a movie or something! I’m serious!
Michael is leaving. And apparently they’ve already hired a new manager. And we’re meeting him today. It’s a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
[wearing wig] Nope! It’s not Ashton Kutcher. It’s Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]
Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it’s own sake. So, without further ado, let’s start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!
Hello! [opens door] How are you sir?
Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
[drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I’ll get that you guys. Don’t… it’s just… you know…
Oh, hi! [obviously flirting body language]
No, not officially, actually, I saw you walking out of the bathroom before.
Well, I guess I’ll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
[offers Kelly the papers as she walks away]
And that is what you call a meet cute.
And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it’s Deangelo the whole time!
Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.
I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
Oh. [chuckles] That was… let’s see, where’s my replacement? Where’s the guy I’m replacing? Why don’t I look to the left? He’s sitting right there! [office laughs]
Oh yeah… I know… that’s what I was just saying… that’s what…
That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. [holds up ‘Hello, my name is..,’] nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.
[laughs] Office funny guy! Always glad to have an office funny guy around!
I wasn’t even trying to make a joke. But I guess I’ve always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.
This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.
Well, congratulations. I have four kids of my own.
Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. [laughs]
Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
Yeah, they don’t ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
Are you kidding? I’d come anywhere to see a turtle? Where’d you find him.
There’s no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
That’s because I’m your right-hand man, Michael, but I can’t do it again. I can’t do it again for a whole new guy.
Now I’m gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I’ll be off all day.
I want to be manager. I just don’t understand why I wasn’t even interviewed for the job. What’s wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
I do a lot of portion control. I try to keep my daily calor intake under 1200. [laughter]
Deangelo, you’re going to starve to death. [laughter]
So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
It’s cool that you like the southwest. It’s one of my favorite regions.
It’s one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
I love the desert. It’s one of my favorite ecosystems.
Here’s the great thing about the southwest; there’s so much more than desert. Along the north rim of the Grand Canyon is a forest as lush as you’ve ever seen.
Burnt! It’s lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he’s a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He’s a great person to know.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
Why do you use your name when you use the phone?
Oh, that’s how Pam does it. I just copy her. She’s sort of a living legend.
Dunder Mifflin, this is… oh, I like it!
Dunder Mifflin, how may I assist you?
I just prefer it without the name and I thought- I’ve got to start doing some managing at some point.
I know, I know, I’m sorry, but if it’s not a big deal we should just-
Well, I’d like to change it, actually.
Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.
You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. [phone rings]
[picks up phone] …I’m so sorry. Sorry. [hangs up]
Hey, funny guy. Wanna have a little mid-day lawl here. Make me laugh, huh? What you got? I can’t even look at you.
Here we go… ok… what do African Americans call… [laughter]
Oh, yeah. Put a pin on that, kid. Can’t wait to hear the punchline.
Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
[a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.
I saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass. Looking at me.
[to Erin] Shave me. [walks into office with Deangelo] This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
Ok, alright! I love it! I love it! Michael, this is Reggie. He is the #1 yelp reviewed shaver in Scranton. It’s not even close.
And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go. [Erin puts too much shaving cream on Michael’s face, none on the neck]
Alright. This is how we do it. Feels nice, doesn’t it?
It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.
Ah, yes, please! Just cozy up there. Just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups.
Well, we don’t really do rap sessions. We kinda do… [Erin shaves Michael] god… we sorta do more of like powwows or-
Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them ‘da-das’.
You know what, enough about your baby, ok? I’m sorry.
We were… I think she was just trying to-
No, no, no, I know what you’re doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? What can I do better?
You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can’t say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
Well, Deangelo, I’d say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don’t even really have to worry about.
Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
I don’t mean to go into a rant here, but…
I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.
…I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don’t. I’m thinking, ‘how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.
Let’s not talk politics in the office, ok? I like you better as a funny guy.
[leans on table] I wasn’t taking a position. It’s just one of those things where- [table collapses under Andy]
[laughter] Now that’s funny! That’s funny! You walk much?
Yeah, right, I mean- [walks into door, jokingly]
[pushing box into office] Deangelo, this box came for you.
Thank you. That’s my stuff. Yeah. Michael, take a look at this.
Oh, that’d be great, thank you Stanley!
You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so… you know, let’s not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I’m still here-
[holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
Yep, ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quartz. Little factoid.
Deangelo’s great. I love the guy. But I’m not sure he’s a great fit for the office. And also, I’m not sure if I love the guy.
Hey, hey, hey! [holds up set of pistols in holsters]
Hey, funny man! Whatcha got for me? Make me laugh?
First thing’s first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would’ve just looped back to me, so, it’s cool you recognized my role here.
Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That’ll put you right on the shortlist for next time there’s an opening.
Can’t you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
From when he recommended me to replace him.
…I’m sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.
[interrupting Deangelo] Snack time! It’s the witching hour! It’s the sandwitching hour!
PB and J, my mom’s recipe! [throws sandwitch at Phyllis]
Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.
I need a wide berth. I need a wide berth from those nuts.
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go! [throws sandwitch into Kevin’s open mouth]
Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O.J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot.
Wait, so, you don’t go into shock or die or anything?
No, Jim, not everything is life or death. I want to feel comfortable.
Oscar, here you go. [throws sandwitch]
[uses book to stop the sandwitch’s flight] You’re getting nut particles all in the air!
No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
[steps into conference room] Everyone, mandatory meeting. Multi-purpose room, now.
No, that’s good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. [disgusted comments by co-workers] No body go in there. Stay where you are.
No, it’s not insane, Oscar. I’m been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you’re gonna throw it all away? No.
Listen, you’re the one who decided to leave. Come on, he’s the new boss, you know we have to do this.
Well, who needs him. Guess it’s just you and me, Dwight.
Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room.
[walks out] Hold on, Hey Michael, Michael, wait up, hold on. Um, so for these meetings do you just jump into business or do you start with some chit-chat or…?
I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you’ll be fine.
Maybe. Maybe not. 50/50. You know what, it is too bad for this place that you’re leaving. [extents hands for hug] Bring it in, come on. [Michael doesn’t accept hug] Ok. [walks back]
Ok. [hugs Deangelo from behind] Why did you have to be so damn good?
I… I’m adequete. I’m half as good as you.
No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
Will you do me a favour and enjoy this time, ok? You’ve worked so hard, get your senioritis on. It’s Lake Havasu time!
Guess I’ve been working so hard I forgot what it’s like to be hardly working.
Ok. What is the Native American girl’s name?
That’s a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable. Very cute.
See, we knew it! If he just met her, he’d understand.
I swear, that baby could be the star of a show entitled ‘Babys I Don’t Care About.’
Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend. [DeAngelo laughs]
Well, you know, why don’t we try it, and if it goes good it’ll be part of my tradition.
Why do you always say that? You’re gonna love it.
[arriving at the first house] Alright let’s go! [DeAngelo runs in the wrong direction] This way, this way! [Michael knocks on the door]
You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
[holds up a camera and DeAngelo meows] Here we go! Have Pam come down.
Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
[next house] Hey Toby! You suck! [throwing eggs at his house]
[arriving at a dumpy looking, unkempt house] I’ve never seen this place in the daylight.
Here we go, alright got it? Set? [the door is ajar, Michael knocks lightly] Hello? [turns around to see Meredith walking towards her house]
Do you usually leave your door unlocked? And ajar?
Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!
Yes you did. That’s right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast!
[walking into the office] Good morning Erin.
I don’t know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or… I don’t know. Maybe I’m going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]
You are getting so funny! [Erin giggles] Very good.
The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn’t just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.
Anything can happen at the Dundies! [DeAngelo laughs] They’re like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!
Nice! [rest of the office looks excited]
Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!
I love when people say like crack when they’ve obviously never done crack.
Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?
I don’t know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
You’re right, you’re right. I’m a middle class broad. [Jim does his “Jim face”]
Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody’s right. They’re like breadsticks on steroids. Right?
Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass.
Think of it as part of your training.
Not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay…
[smiling] Okay, well we’ll work on it.
[whispers to Michael] Michael, I’m very, very bad.
[all in conference room] Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.
Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a-
[cutting him off] Okay, okay. You know what, I didn’t actually lose my keys…
Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it’s all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay. [Ryan stands next to Michael up front] Ryan how are you today?
Why don’t you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
[very excited] There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration.  Just be funny.
Uhhh, you sir! [points to Jim] Are we having fun tonight?
This is so weird! If I’m conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance… I-I fall apart. Obviously.
Why don’t you think of hosting the Dundies like you’re just running a meeting.
No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
Why don’t you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
[laying down, Michael is sitting on DeAngelo’s stomach bouncing up and down in Michael’s office] Me mo. Me mo.
Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court and choose between them.
THE DUNDIES ARE-OW-ABOUT COMING TOGETHER! AND RECOGNIZING, THE ADOMINABILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT! [Jim comes and closes the door]
[bad Australian accent attempt] THE DUNDIES!
[also in a poor Australian accent] The Dundies!
[Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don’t understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
Yeah… [they see Erin eating in her car, and ducking when they see her. Pam knocks on her car window] Hey, Erin, everything okay?
Get away from the car, he’s gonna see you.
[desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]
Please! Sorry. Get in. [Jim and Pam are confused and worried] Sorry sorry sorry.
I eat lunch in the car now.  It’s my alone time. It’s just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
Why don’t you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
I, really don’t like spending time with him.
Don’t you think it’s better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!
I’m sorry, that just wasn’t interesting to me.
I can’t just dump him Pam, I’m not like you, I can’t be mean.
Wait, when am I…? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don’t love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods]
[standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus]
Appalling. [Meredith walks in] Eye sore. [Jim and Pam come in] Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
DeAngelo, Jo’s on the phone for you.
[Michael dressed as Jo Bennett, using a bad Southern accent] DeAngelo! We’re in serious horse manure here! The Dundies are tonight! And we ain’t got no host!
He’s in Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway. Now we need Michael Scott! The best darn Dundies host on both sides of the Mississippi! [everyone in the audience is laughing]
Ughhh, I gotta find Michael Scott! And then I gotta, [Russel Brand impression] Get Him to the Dundies!
[in the office near the accountants] Hey, can you help me find Michael Scott Angela?
[Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he’s a state senator.
Oh wait, he can’t help because that title has no meaning!
Try Jim DeAngelo, he’ll be able to help.
Jim! Do you know where I can find Michael Scott?
[Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim’s actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don’t know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
No one is listening to me! And I’m running out of time!
[Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!
Maybe I just need to look into my heart. [in the bathroom in front of the mirror] DeAngelo, where is Michael Scott. [his reflection in the mirror turns around to reveal that it is Michael]
I’m here. [DeAngelo gasps and turns around] In a good way! I’ve been here the whole time.
The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
[in the bathroom] DeAngelo, what are you doing? There’s a live audience out there!
No, Ryan would never do it. It’s too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It’s sort of our perk!
This was not, part of the job description!
Listen to me, you’re not doing this for me, you’re not doing this for you, you’re not even doing this for them!
[slaps him] You’re doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid’s menu, wondering: Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say: It’s showtime. Get out there.
Hit me again. [Michael slaps him once more]
Now hit me. [DeAngelo slaps him] One, two, three.
Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line. [everyone laughs]
Fall asleep right after sex. Huh guys?
There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! [Dwight plays a celebratory honking noise on his keyboard]
Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you’re watching this at home it’s way past your bedtime, by the way how’d this get televised?
I don’t know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don’t know, I don’t know. Thank you!
Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie. [Pam gets ready and Jim smiles at her] I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
[jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I’m not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I’m very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It’s, it’s so subjective.
I have diabetes too. You don’t see me making a big deal about it.
[the manager of Louie Volpies approaches a giggling Kevin, who is coloring with crayons on the tablecloth] Who gave you those crayons?
I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
This is a cloth tablecloth! You can’t color on it!
Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
I’m not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.
[escorts Erin off stage] There you go.
It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. [DeAngelo jogs up and takes the Dundie and tries to go back to his seat]
Okay, okay. [trying to stop him from offending other people in his restaurant]
THAT’S WHY IT’S BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR MOST OF THE EVENING…
[stopping Manager] DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.
This is truly special, for me! And uh, anyway. It’s so much lighter!
Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
I know I’m the cause of this royal screw up but I would like to see this show go on.
No, no. You’re being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
Let’s grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. [others nod in agreement]
So what you’re saying is you kinda like it? [Phyllis impression] I’ve fallen and I can’t get up! [normal again] That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
I don’t know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
[to Stanley, who is cracking up again] You were laughing right?
[with Dwight and Michael outside Michael’s car] You know what, I have to go to the bathroom.
I can just run over to the gas station.
We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
That’s true, we wouldn’t get seats together.
[in the car] You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.
I thought it was the worst Dundies I’ve ever been to.
Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
Gladly! I’d accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
[as Michael pulls over and stops the car] Please don’t stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you’re sitting in the backseat, baby.
I just don’t see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
And next time, why don’t you pick a co-host, that doesn’t have microphone-a-phobia!
[very uncomfortable] Look, what ever you’re going to do, how long is it going to take? Ballpark. ‘Cause I just, I gotta make a decision here. [gets out and slams the door]
[in conference room] Here… [Andy walks in] Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard! [Andy walks up]
A lot of people I’d like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.
[starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]
[singing] Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That’s how many minutes, that you’ve worked here.
Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That’s like watching Die Hard, eighty thousand times!
Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call.
[falsetto] Measure your life in love!
Remember to call, remember to, call. Remember to call.
[choked up] Yeah, okay. [pauses, then takes a deep breath] Well this is gonna hurt like a mother[bleep].
[Toby is shaking his head, no] It’s his last Dundies.
Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it! [Toby comes up and take the mic]
Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.
[Michael takes one and bites] Oh, these do not taste like oysters.
[angrily] That’s because they’re Not oysters, they’re bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!
What is wrong with you? I’m the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn’t recommend me?!
I don’t own Dunder Mifflin, okay? [Dwight scoffs] The job was not mine to give. [sighs] Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.
Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket…
Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
[with Michael in his office] You’re not gonna take all these toys are you?
I mean you don’t have a job lined up, so it’s not like you have a desk to put ’em on.
That’s nice. [reaches and a grabs a toy truck] How ’bout that truck? Can I have this little truck? I was thinking I might… glue a stapler on top. Or put a hole here, stick pens in it. [Michael gives an obviously fake smile] You okay?
Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.
You know what? Uh, it’s your last couple days, I’m gonna get out of your hair.
Sad? No, no, no. I don’t leave ’til tomorrow, so… Tomorrow I will be a wreck.
[sees Andy walk into the Men’s Room and follows him in] Stay away from Erin! [cornering him in the bathroom]
Why don’t you, uh, stay away from me?
No, I’m gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don’t wanna get on my bad side! I’ve seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!
Okay! That’s so weird! Just go away!
No! You go away! [storms out, toilet flushes, Jim exits the bathroom]
So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
[in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?
[walking in] There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!
Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
The three of us have all been chairmen before.
[walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!
[to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
You know what, I’m thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody’ll like. How about vanilla? Let’s get vanilla.
Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?
What kind of toppings would you like?
Sounds good. Fudge it up! [all seem surprised at Michael’s behavior]
[pulls out a list of everyone in the office, then puts it back in his jacket] Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis.
When Phyllis was in high school, she was so… cute. [Phyllis looks relieved] And she still is.
I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
[holds up mittens she’s knitting] Look Michael, it’s a going away present so your hands won’t get cold.
It’s almost done, but you can’t get them wet, and they can’t be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt. [gives Stanley a small felt table] May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
Where’s the rest of it, it’s got no balls.
Well, okay… And Andy, Andy who needs confidence  that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts. [other salesmen look outraged]
You know I’m the worst salesman here right?
But you’re the best salesman, on the inside.
You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.
Just do your best! I have faith in you.
[as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!
I’ve given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
[rips the poster in half] Don’t be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?
Good, stand up. [Kevin does so] You will be thin. You Won’t drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
Michael, I’m pretty much okay with who I am now.
Don’t be. You should never settle for who you are. [moving on] Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-
I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost ’em!
[laughing] It looks like a [more laughing] It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! [laughs more] He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point?
How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
Who’s that? Who’s that guy? [points to second guy in the pictures]
[walking into the kitchen, DeAngelo is using the coffee machine to cook chicken covered in melted chocolate] Hey.
[hurriedly, while hiding the chocolate covered chicken] Hey!
I’m going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.
Let’s rip it up homes. [smacks top of the door frame with his hand, leaving a chocolate hand outline]
[Andy walks by with DeAngelo, says quietly after he leaves] Walk away bitch.
[Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
You have an address yet in Colorado?
What town do Holly’s parents live in?
[Michael sits alone eating at the back of the kitchen, Pam comes in with Jim, Creed and Kevin] You should do more stuff like that.
[to Michael] Hey! It’s almost your last day, come sit with us.
So I’m going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
It’s a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
It’s not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
No, it’s just… that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that’ll shred magazines.
I don’t think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay?
No, no. I just needed to hear your voice.
[laughing] Yes. [Olive Oyl impression] Yes my hero!
[deep man voice] I’ll pay the rent! [Michael laughs] Okay, my mom’s looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It’s a joke mom!
Well I’ll see you tonight. I’ll pick you up outside baggage claim.
Okay. I’ll see you tonight. I love you.
Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.
[grimaces and nods, Toby nods back at him] Okay.
[walks over to Kelly] Kelly! Kelly? Kelly.
[doing make up and irritated] What?!
If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?
Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
[in Ryan’s office, which is illuminated blue] She was once my girl, and she is your girl now.
Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael’s St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan’s office]
[in conference room with the party planning committee] So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
See? This is what happens. You can’t let a stray dog into the house.
Hmm, let’s hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]
I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
They make these cakes, they’re wild! I mean, they show everything!
I know what you’re thinking, but it’s not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they’re not just guy’s fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
[stopping her] Okay, don’t turn this into some feminist issue.
As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
You know what, I think we should get some other input.
I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
No! I’m not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don’t really care about your opinion. You’re just a tie-breaker.
[sees Pam walking towards the door of the office] Um, Pam.
Oh, hey Michael! I’m just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I’ll see you later.
[disappointed] Okay… [Jim is confused]
[walking into the women’s bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!
You can’t be in here. This is a lady’s room!
Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that’s what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women’s room.
Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one. [leans in for a kiss]
[on video cam with his brother] Here’s the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.
I can bring him a welcome basket. I’ll surprise him.
Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-
Does he like jams? My shelves are over flowing with preserves.
[walking into Darryl’s office] Darryl!
I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage. [hands him a thin black folder] Unfinished. If there’s anyone here who can finish it, it’s you.
That’s sweet Mike. Let’s see here. There’s a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
Mmmhmmm. It’s true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer.
[in warehouse] Darryl said I could use the bailer because I’m leaving.
[picks up a basketball and dribbles it away from the basket] Alright guys, well… see ya later warehouse. Catch you on the flippity flip. [throws the ball behind him and misses the basket, tries and misses several more times]
[in car with Andy] okay, so what’s our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What? [Andy stares blankly] Hmm?
I thought we’d just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.
That’s stupid. [laughing. Nervously, Andy laughs with him]
[still laughing] What do you know? We gotta get psyched up! Okay? Guy? Let’s get psyched! Is there an animal shelter on the way?
Awesome! Ani Ani Shelto! Here we come. Do you know how to high-five?
[at the animal shelter with Andy] You know how I met Jo Bennett? And got started on my ladder of success?
Gimme that dog! That’s not your dog! [takes the dog from a confused Andy] Yeah! Again.
Gimme that damn dog you f***ing thief! Don’t ever do It again! [Andy nods modestly] You hear me?! [Andy nods again] You feel that energy?
Wooo! Yeah! [parades in circles with the dog, pretends to whack Andy with it] [giving it to Andy] Okay, again.
I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he’s begging me to reconsider, but I… I just think I’m in love with someone else.
I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
Okay. [both chuckling. Michael leaves Erin, looking thoughtful]
[on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?
No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I’m on a sale!
Listen to me. It’s two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.
Okay… [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. [pulls out an envelope from his jacket]
So I wanted to give you that. [hands him the envelope] It’s a letter of recommendation. [Dwight looks eager. Michael nods to him and walks away]
This is gonna be good. [eagerly reading the letter] To whom it may concern. [off to the side] Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. [reading again] The dictionary defines superlative as:
[opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]
[in the office, crosses Dwight off his list. He has paint in his messed up hair, and is containing his laughter]
[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
[looks at the clock to see it is three o’clock] Jim where is Pam?
Uhh, she’s still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
But it is already three o’clock! [Michael leaves, Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
[walks into a movie theater showing The King’s Speech]
[in his office talking to Creed, Gabe, and Meredith in that order] Whether you’re scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don’t be. It’s going to be okay.
Yeah I was tripling up. There’s not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
[Gabe is still standing in front of Michael’s desk] And you, why are you still here.
[sounding hurt] I’m either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy’s career is destroyed.
[walking out the client’s room with Andy] That is cold sir! Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time.
Uh DeAngelo, I’m, uh. I forgot my bag, so I’ll meet you in the car.
[on his phone waiting for Andy, next to their car] Yes. Okay, alright. No, well thank you! Alright, take care. [hangs up] You’ll never guess, we did it!
[laughing] Hey! [they hug] Good job boss!
[standing in front of his office, sees that it is three forty five] Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let’s go! Hurry up, let’s do this! [Dwight runs into the conference room. All others follow]
They’re almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
[cutting her off] Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
[brings Michael into his office] So I’ve been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
You’re not leaving tomorrow. You’re leaving today right?
Wow, so that’s it huh? Just, four o’clock and you are gone for good.
Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?
Absolutely not. It’s just that sometimes… goodbyes are a bitch.
[pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man…
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
And then tomorrow, I can tell you… what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
[hears a taxi honking] Oh shoot! That’s my cab.
Listen Michael, I really… I did text Pam, but…
I know, it’s okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?
[shakes Michael’s hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.
Okay… [crosses Jim off his list] Phyllis.
[drinking from Michael’s World’s Best Boss mug] See ya tomorrow boss!
[watching Michael’s plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn’t sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award’s member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
[to Jim] Uh oh… [Jim, tearful, nods]
Change two, Toby, you’re gettin’ a new chair.
Don’t thank me!  Hey, don’t thank me, guy!  Okay?  And I don’t care if you like it.
These sound like good ideas, why wouldn’t we like them?
I don’t care what your favorite flavor is.  Here’s a bowl of ice cream.  You either like it or you don’t.  [Andy nods] That’s my attitude right now in this room, that’s my attitude on Ice Cream Thursdays.  Alright?  Clear?  Any questions?
This all sounds great to me.  [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they’re bad.  I don’t know what to think.
That is a s–  astute observation, Kevin.
[continuing to talk to Darryl] And if you’re really serious, you should go in the spring.
No.  Because the entire state smells like Earth.
No he doesn’t.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
Every time there’s a silence, your brain’s like “Heh-heh-huh-huh” [imitating crying].
Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
Oh, there’s an inner circle.  Oh yeah.
There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
Jim only says that because he’s in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn’t exist.
[holding two cups of coffee] There he is!  Got ya coffee.  [offers cup to Dwight]
Oh, wow, thank you.  That was so kind of you.  [throws cup in the garbage]
It’s just that I own the coffee shop.  So, once you’ve seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it’s so much fun.
Listen.  I’ve got a sixer.  “Automatic for the People” on the jukebox.  Let’s hit the park after sundown.  Come on!  Pick up some sausage if you want.
I think you’ll find what you’re looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.
No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn’t seem to want anything to do with me.  It reminds me of my relationship with my son.  Except there, I’m the Dwight.
Who’s the biggest client in the state?  I say we go get ’em, whatever it takes.  Huh?  What do you guys say?
Right!  Or my other idea, 50,000 tiny clients.
[shoots mini basketball at hoop on office door, misses badly] Is that ball lighter than usual?  Is that a Chinatown knockoff?
No, that’s definitely a knockoff.  You can feel the center of gravity’s off.  Feel that.  [throws ball to Gabe]  What do you think?
[holding ball in open palm] Oh, yeah, totally.  Jim, you got ripped off big time.
[calling for the ball] Deangelo! [shoots and makes it]  See what I did there?  That’s what you need to do.  [makes shooting gesture] It’s that little English.  The British are coming.
Hey Ry.  Your department’s killing it, baby. [puts arm around Ryan]
Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I’ll tell you what I would have done for you.  I’d lie for you.
Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.
[hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don’t have those call logs on my desk, we’re just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
[whispers to Kelly]  You’re the best.  Thank you.
You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name.  So I’ve never had to buy it.  True story.  I just drink my cousin’s.
Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.
You know what… straight up, why don’t you like me?
I’m just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don’t you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?
Yes.  Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes [starts to run out of the break room] yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes!
[looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled “administrative” and “assistant.”
What’s wrong with juggling, Darryl?  I’m a big juggler.  I actually perform a motivational juggling routine.
Oh yeah.  I’d do it for you here, but uh, what would you say this room is, 300 square feet?  320?
It’s a little cramped.  How many square feet out there?  17, 18 hundo?
Sorry gang.  Thought my juggling stuff was in the trunk of my car.  It’s not.
I gotcha covered, boss.  Used to play with the parabolas myself. [opens desk drawer and takes out balls]  Got some extra balls!  [throws them toward Deangelo, who dodges them]  Hey-hey-hey-ho!
No.  Never.  Can someone please throw me a fifth ball?  If you dare!  [Kevin pretends to throw ball]  Incoming!  And we’re on!  Remember, nothing’s impossible!  Phyllis, where’s Phyllis?
[imitating Deangelo’s pretend juggling routine] Look.  I’m juggling eggs and bowling balls.  I’m juggling with one hand.  No hands.
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?
He’s good at his job.  And I like working for him.
Of course you do, Jim.  You’re a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think if he was sexist, I’d be able to tell.  I took a crapload of women’s studies courses at Cornell.  And I wrote my own companion piece to the “Vagina Monologues” called the “Penis Apologies.”  So I know a thing or two.
Okay.  Then how about I’m the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
How could I not see it?  You’re so right.
[to Jim] Why don’t you talk to him about it?
And say what?  “Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?”
Why don’t you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
And if he doesn’t listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye.  Snip snip.  Am I right, girls?
Yeah, I got tons of time.  This job’s a joke.
Umm, really, it’s nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was —
[opening door to Deangelo’s office] Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?
Yeah sure.  Let’s make it a meeting. [Darryl, Kevin, Gabe enter office]
If it’s alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over —
What’s the big secret?  Why are you even whispering?  Come on, it’s the guys!
Maybe there’s a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are…a little sexist, or —
Are you serious?  Who feels this way?
That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin…
Guys.  Hold on.  Doesn’t matter who, okay?  I’m just happy that Jim brought it to my attention because honestly, I had – I had no idea.
[on phone] Mom, Ryan’s taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he’s not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won’t ever stand us up again.
[joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when —
Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand new executive assistant?
I’m not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren’t.
What’s the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.
Man, you’re smart.  [Erin arrives with new executive assistant]  Oh, hey!  Hi!  Hello.  Welcome.  Uh, everyone, I’d like you to please welcome Jordan Garfield.  This is everyone.
So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?
No, Anthropology.  We don’t have this in that size, pretty lame.
That’s like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
So, umm, is this your first office job then?
No corporate experience whatsoever.  I didn’t want anyone with any bad habits.
[heading into Deangelo’s office] Jim, you coming?
Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight’s phone vibrates]
[holds up phone and looks into Deangelo’s office] No!
Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.
He didn’t text me.  [Andy’s phone chimes]
I’m going in, into the belly of the beast.  Gonna infiltrate and change from within.  [joins the group in Deangelo’s office]  What’s up, mancave! [makes barking noises]
[to Jim] Just go in.  Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.
Internally, for office use [Jim quietly enters Deangelo’s office and sits down] where do we get our paper from?  Do we go –
[to Jordan] Don’t worry, the first day’s always the hardest.
Nope.  Just… [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
Dwight?  Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there’s anything I can help you with.
Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods.  And she becomes…The Horse Flyer.
Hey!  Kelly, that’s the last time I’m gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you’re only here for the money, maybe you shouldn’t be here at all.
I’m sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can’t do this.  I can’t do this.  I’m sorry.  I just can’t do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn’t had a real job here in years.
No, he’s just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He’s like Rango.  He doesn’t work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn’t save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.
Okay, I don’t have time for this he said-she said.
It’s too murky.  I like Ryan.  You seem kind of hysterical to me.  Ryan’s your supervisor.  Let’s just leave it that way.
That’s not fair, I mean, I’ve been working here for such a long ti– [Deangelo walks away]
[sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don’t you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
[knocking on door to Deangelo’s office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it’s really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
Well, that’s gonna be tough, because we’re getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself.
[chuckles] Oh, you mean Michael Jordan?
I’m no MJ.  I can do his dunk.  From the free throw line.
The man is paying me to take Chinese.  I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
Okay.  We’ll keep that in mind.  Alright, ladies, back to the game.
You know what?  Instead of a game, why don’t we do an exhibition?  I’d love to see that dunk of yours.
Today.  Now, maybe.  ‘Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don’t have to mime it.
Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. [laughter] Let’s go downstairs!  Okay?  Let’s do it.
Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I’d lock Mose in the chicken coop.
Damn it, Dwight!  Enough!  Get your ass downstairs or find a new place to sell paper! [Dwight immediately gets up and walks out]
Okay, a little about me.  I respond to strong leadership.
Seems a little close, you sure that’s the real foul line?
15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
And uh, you know what, to make it interesting, Jordan, why don’t you sit underneath the basket?
Yeah, come on.  I’ll dunk over you.  Best seat in the house.
I don’t, I don’t think I can do that.  I’m holding your jewelry.
Right.  Yeah.  Okay, fair enough.  Kevin, you do it.
Yes!  Okay. [sits down in front of basket]
Someone want to sit in Kevin’s lap?  Angela?
Okay, Jimmy, this is for you.  Show you that anything is possible.
This is also for the troops.  [backs up, bounces ball, starts running, jumps, lands in front of Kevin, jumps again, pulls himself up by the net, dunks ball, hangs on rim]  Doctor is in! [hoop starts to fall] Ahhhh! [hoop crashes down on Deangelo]
[ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?
[Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?
Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
[lots of gibberish] says to bartender [lots more gibberish]  Droswip.  Droswip.
Droswip, yeah.  I get it.  Okay, we’re gonna get you to the restroom.
All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]
[on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager’s office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]
Mose… you’ll never guess where I am right now.
Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation…
…indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [Kevin finishes behind the rest of the group]
I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
[quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
[clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.
It’s none of your business, actually. It’s very medical and personal.
All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]
In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so…
Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
Sure. What’s going on? [in room with Gabe]
Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can’t be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?
No. I don’t like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?
Yeah, fine, I promise. We’ll never date again. Can we go outside now?
No, just give me a second. I don’t want anyone to know I’ve been crying.
[seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you’re doing? What’s this? What’s the Fist?
Oh, it’s just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It’s just a club. Guys talking, you know.
You expect me to believe that you’re starting a rebellion?
Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it’s a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]
[inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One…
[refills his coffee near a sign that reads “Honor System:
Pam, I have to show you this video. You’re gonna love it. It’s Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]
I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
[looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
[on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or – [Gabe ends the call]
Erin, I am in love with you. I don’t believe in much, okay? I don’t believe in horoscopes. I don’t believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don’t believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback]
Dwight doesn’t trust robots to give us our messages.
Well… it’s just… [ringing] it messes up my rhythm.
I’m taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
Wow, you’ve really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha’s a rescue.
The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein’s desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I’m a very busy man. Let’s get right down to business.
Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you’ll be on your best behavior.
I promise…d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so…
You can’t fire me. You’re acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
Watch this. You’re pre-fired. And when I’m promoted, you’ll be full fired.
[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven’t fallen in love with me by then.
If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, “Well that’s pretty premature to think,” but I always say, it’s better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
Everyone here thinks that you’re a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won’t last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you’ll age swiftly and poorly.
Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don’t want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh… it’s a holster.
[walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin’ good. [grunts] Ohh… [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day.
The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don’t know. I guess he’s saying that he’s proud of me.
Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.
The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can’t walk around wearing an empty holster.
Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
You could put your cell phone in it instead.
Uh… hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt]
Why would I put a banana in my holster?
In case you weren’t hungry now, but you got hungry later.
Dwight, no gun, okay? Don’t make us call Jo.
Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out – aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy’s ear, making everyone jump]
My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
[trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee… There’s like this crazy ringing going on. I can’t – eeeeeee… I can’t find perfect C.
Okay, everyone make a list of what’s lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That’s all we know! No. That’s not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
[scatting off-key] Something’s definitely wrong.
I’ll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
[buzzer to indicate a blocked site] Firewall.
I can’t reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
No! We really shouldn’t be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support]
[excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I’ve never used the gun violence forms before.
Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy’s tie look like?
I have no way of knowing if that’s true.
I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands]
Would you consider this a terrorist incident?
Oh, there’s a whole ‘nother terrorism booklet for that.
I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn’t hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don’t feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
[singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
Pet Day! I want Pet Day back – no dogs.
Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
I put everything back in the vending machine.
Put everything back in the vending machine except… the fruit.
You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I’m on the spot. I don’t know. Um… you know what? I think I’m good.
Nope. When Jo’s here, can you work in “Shagadelic, baby,” at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
[quickly shakes his hands back and forth]
[leaves the men’s room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]
[after entering the men’s room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my…
Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don’t seem to know they’re brothers.
Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?
Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert – the only man that ever turned me down.
Well, I don’t know about that. Just wasn’t for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic. [Jim coughs]
[does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.
Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?
I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying…
And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is… between me and my diary.
Oscar, can you print out last year’s sale statements?
My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.
Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]
You’re kidding me. [reaches under Kevin’s jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It’s moist.
Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
Dwight! Walk me out. Let’s talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it – it’s nice to have a little power, eh? How’s it feel?
Jo… I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It’s not even in the same – you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?
It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
Beaumont-Adams is a girl’s gun. That just makes it plain stupid.
Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius.
I love you, Dwight. But you don’t fit this job.
[on the verge of tears] Jo, please… I will –
No, child. No. It’s over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement.
You three are my search committee. You’re in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty?
Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who’s got the most experience in this office?
Uh, well, we probably don’t want to go just on seniority.
[giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one…
Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six…
[to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language]
[pointing at a whiteboard with BOBODDY written on the left side, vertically] BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first “B” stand for?
We’re making acronyms. Okay! What does the first “B” stand for?
I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! [writes after the first B, I, Z, N, U…] All right! The “O”…
[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
Absolutely–I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits.
[waiting for Fred to continue] …What is it?
I’m sorry, what is your three-step plan?
Well, I mean, I can’t just hand you my plan. I mean, if you guys give me the job, then, then you’ll get the plan.
Well… it’s an interview, and we don’t know that you really have the plan.
[speaking faster] Well, I’m not gonna just make up that I have a plan. I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it. You’re in paper, right?
How would we know that, if you don’t…
You could just be saying it to get the job.
I guess I could be, if I was… who would do that?
How about this. Why don’t you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
Tell you what. I’ll give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part.
That’s a verbal trademark. That’s an agreement.
[in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.
I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company’s owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn’t hurt that I’m… [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
[puts up a poster in the break room with “IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY” on it in bold lettering]
[commenting on the poster] It’s good. I really hope you get it!
The manager job? Nah, I’m barely interested. I just can’t not go for it. You know, it’s not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
Still, I’d really like to see this office with you in the boss’s chair.
Don’t even… [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!
[checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?
Oh, I’m sure they’ll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but…
But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky’s had come out.
Yeah. I’m sure I was just another Porky’s baby.
[to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?
They won’t make me manager, and I won’t settle for anything less. I’ve gone about as far as I can here. That’s obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas ain’t cheap, you know.
Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
How about 27? And uh, when I make long-distance calls, will they be monitored or is it on the honor system?
[on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator’s office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
The Botanical Gardens, Scranton’s hidden gem. Don’t eat any berries you don’t recognize.
How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?
Okay, I-I am, I’m almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?
Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?
No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim]
Can you… [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence… would be… in a dialogue with a subordinate?
Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.
[more emphatically than Jim] Yes. You do. [nods at the Search Committee, then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face]
[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.
[Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl.
Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don’t see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]
Oh? Uh… we haven’t started the interview yet. Were you–were you joking?
Uh… [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
Well, it’s one of my strengths, but it’s the manager’s job.
Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
I’ll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions… and consequences… of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]
[noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who’s that?
[ignoring Darryl’s question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we’ll be good right?
Yeah, it’s no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]
Let me… [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]
[at the cafe on the first floor] Did, uh, you just interview?
That business can’t attract anyone. It’s awful up there. Those people seem like they’re in prison, waiting out life sentences in a… dying industry.
Place must be horrible. I don’t know if I want this job. [gets on elevator]
[in elevator] Well, if I get this job offer, and then I know that I’m gonna take it, and if I take it, I know that I’m never gonna quit, and then 25 years are gonna go by and… I’m gonna die here.
What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.
I know you now, your nature. I’m done. Not worth continuing. [at the same time, Dwight says:
Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it’s made?
I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street. [nods at Dwight mockingly]
I’m gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That’s because I just threw it in the ring.
You guys pay for relocation, though, right?
Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?
Well, I’d want to move further away, you know? Just… I don’t want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office.
Can I ask why you’re leaving your current job?
Is this a bad time to be doing this?
I’m sorry, if we did something to upset you, I’m sure it was inadvertent.
[continues to chew, slower and slower, appears confused] Wait.
Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met.
[limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
[looking at an engagement ring on Angela’s finger] It’s gorgeous, Angela.
Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
It’s a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet’s Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, ’cause it’s so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator’s wife?
[laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim’s voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]
Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]
Angela’s engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I’m horrified. As a friend of Angela’s, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I’m a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
Okay, guys, it’s time. It’s pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
I think Andy should be the boss. He’s just so great. If I’m being objective, then Darryl, of course.
So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here… [gets cut off by Gabe]
Whoa! That’s a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
Well, Toby’s in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby’s done a fine job.
Right! I really wasn’t trying to insult any, anyone.
How many windows are there in New York City?
Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.
Okay. Let me think… are you counting car windows?
Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and… [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,…
Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! [slams fist, hurting his hand]
[alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!
[on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say “Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was… [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.
Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.
[takes the pictures] Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.
Well, I manage my department, and I’ve been doing that for several years now. And, god, I’ve learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just… [does a “wrap it up” motion with his pen]
We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so… [nods]
[getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?
What do you want me to say? I mean, there’s a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to– okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?
[comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.
[walking with Jim in the parking lot] How’s the family?
What’s your daughter’s name again? Peepee?
Great! Oh, that’s great… We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
You’re not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
Okay, I know why you’re saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim’s throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
[pulls Dwight’s arm down] Okay. That’s vivid.
Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]
Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn’t trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
Fine. I’ll do it without you, but you’ll regret this.
Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim]
The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.
And don’t say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
Forget it. I’m never gonna know what goes on there.
My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
You’re thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.
No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
‘Cause he’s totally gay? [walks away]
Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He “liked” my facebook photos at 3 o’clock in the morning.
[trying to cut off Phyllis] I… I don’t think I can do that.
If my daughter were asking me… [both giggle]
I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,… go get them.
So, uh… here you go. [gives resume to Jim]
The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how’d he do?
Ehh, that’s not who I’m talking about.
[checks sheet] Oh… Deshaun Williams.
He’s an amazing man. He’s a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser…
Come on man. I’m being serious. Don’t joke.
Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim’s desk and walks away]
First, I’ll take down the cubicle walls.
Symbol of transparency. There’d be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I’d take your job, but I’d reject the title.
Everyone would be known for their accomplishments.
That’s very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?
Well, I’ll tell you how. Shall I? I’ll tell you how.
By splitting the difference. Just… just, somewhere in the middle.
I think that’s probably all we need to hear from…
Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That’s what I’d do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There’d be no desks. You just sit on the floor.
You’ve got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!
Sockee!… is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don’t, whatever, just talk to her! She’s a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you…you are cracking to go. [smiles]
You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
Well, there must be someone who stands out.
No, not at all. In fact, I’m not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I’m just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don’t have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
[in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley… you’ll live forever…
My next boss will be my last boss. He’ll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim’s coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]
You pick a crappy boss, you’re responsible for my crappy life. [leaves]
Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels… James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
[walks in with her dogs] Gabe, honey! Oh, lord. Take all this. [gives the dog leashes and multiple bags to Gabe]
Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?
Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2.5 billion units of inventory. 2.5 billion, Darryl? 2.5 billion units of what?
[softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
[clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I’ve learned so much from them. I’d like to be interviewed for the position.
Question 1. Ever shot a gun in the office?
I don’t think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That’s hot.
You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
You’re right. You’re right. She seems happy. We don’t tell her.
Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
[to Jordan] Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. [closes his office door]
It’s Creed. FYI, I’m starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
Hehehe, cool. Let’s keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don’t want you to be a dead mamma jamma.
[knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He’s a burn victim.
[motions toward her face] He’s all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
No, send him in. [to Search Committee] Who is this?
[mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager.
[in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.
Oh, that’s my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn’t hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That’s a travesty.
I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question. [Gabe gets up to leave] If he isn’t here in sixty seconds…
Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo… [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It’s me. I’m Dwight.
[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you’re Dwight, and then… he’s the… [trails off]
Very unprofessional, “Jacques.” Or, should I say, Dwight.
Let’s just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what?
I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you’d ever seen!
That’s f***ing crazy. [Jo and Dwight both smile] Get outta here. [Dwight leaves] What a nutjob.
This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, “just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.”
Okay, it’s fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who’s got ya excited?
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
Who’s this fella? Went to Cornell. What’s wrong with him?
How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability. [makes a “zero” hand gesture]
So it’s not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you?
Oh, Jo. Jo, I’m disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was…
Gabe…ugh… you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Let’s get you back to Florida. We’ll figure out something for you.
It’s not. Let’s get Kelly in here to take his place.
‘Cause Gabe’s tall and weak. She’s short and strong. I’m doing an opposites thing.
You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn’t a good fit.
Well, I’m not saying you must hire her. If you find someone who’s clearly a fit, then fine. Just make sure they fit real good. No more manager turnover. Don’t mess this up, Jim. And give Dwight an interview. I like a little bit of crazy.
[hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!
[giggling, walks to Erin’s desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
And there’s only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
It’s good. It’s just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me… but, if any kids are watching… A, B, and so forth. You know,… M-N-L-O, P… F…
[as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.
A date with the best salesman… Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin’s desk]
Where’d you learn how to puppet like that?
Listen, I’m really flattered, but I don’t think we should.
[loudly] Stanley, I won’t be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
[looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope… you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let’s discuss.
Okay! If you’re not going to interview me, then I’ll do it.
Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You’ll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you’re gonna like the call you’re going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I’m just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]
[sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I’m impressed.
I don’t know, Jim, ’cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
I don’t know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
Well, we could try him out for a little while… [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn’t work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in…
Is it true that you’re making Dwight the manager?
He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
No, no, no. Not ever, ’cause that’s not gonna happen.
Well, it’s not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone’s getting a little power-mad.
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I’m going a little bit crazy.
Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?
Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Okay… well what do ‘I’ want in a manager?… let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do ‘I’ want?…
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
What do ‘I’ want?… I’m looking for someone… who… [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
I’m sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I’m a singer, I’m a fashion designer.
Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn’t see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
No, you’re right, Pam, let’s just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
No, I want you to say that you think the ‘best’ person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
I got away with… everything, under the last boss, and it wasn’t good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don’t just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me… when I’m in the mood… to be led.
I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let’s hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]
She may have a point there… would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.
Ohh, hey Gabe, I’m sorry, we… we didn’t get you a cake or anything. We’re gonna miss you.
Oh, well I’m still the corporate liaison to the branch.
You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.
Okay, you know what, you don’t need to make that sound.
I’m sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I’m a terrific hugger. I’ve been with a bunch of girls where that’s basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
[various] Good luck! Goodbye! Good luck at your new job.
We’re gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]
[stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I’m educated. I’m capable. I like all of you… and I won’t make any changes.
I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I’m standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I’m like…
Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin’s hair with her hand]
No, we’re not related. I got the call. But… I’ll tell her some other day. [smiles]
What about Darryl? We can all agree that he’s a stand-up guy, right?
Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there’s a great, lively debate here, but let’s think about-
No, no,… no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]
[enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn’t disrupt your meeting.
Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager?
[sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.
I don’t know if he’d be a good manager [Jim shakes his head and looks wide-eyed at Darryl], but he’s a really great dad!
Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let’s go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]
It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
I don’t know. This conversation really got away from me.
Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I’m about to do that.
This job? Oh, yeah, I’ll get it. Jo’s an old friend. I think… I’m her best friend. She’s not my best friend.
Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin… especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
No, I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life. I will be the new boss of… [looks back to glance at lobby directory] Vance Refrigeration.
Honestly, I think I… I sabotaged myself. It’s like I’m afraid of being happy. Case in point… I was supposed to start another job today.
[chuckles] I will get offered the job. That’s a… call I’ve received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause… while they wait to hear my response, and then… my response.
I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or… [shrugs] I don’t know. Something always works out. [leaves]
You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
[in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right?
Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. [Pam puts down phone and picks it back up]
[in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Hello!
Hi, how are ya? [Erin looks amused, Stanley and Phyllis look at Pam, confused]
Ohho! I’m good! Don’t you just love paper, and things about paper!
Hey, are you single? This seems like a love connection to me!
Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don’t.  And I don’t.  But I am so excited to be a part of it.
[exiting elevator] After you my good sir.
(planking on top of cabinet] Very smart.
K… Kevin! [Kevin planking on Dwight’s desk]
Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly]
No, I told you I don’t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.
Look, it’s a ‘Little Pregs’ [points to her belly] and ‘Big Pregs’ [points to Pam’s]
Wait, when did we start calling it that-
Isn’t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
Well, I am a few months ahead of you.
I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim… the great salesman.
Hoist him aloft. C’mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]
Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin’ much better. This soda. This is mine.
It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I’m telling someone how to do somethin’. I go on with a long description and then I say, “and shove it up your butt.” It’s stupid, but it’s my thing now.
Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?
[starts attacking plankers] Kids, don’t try planking. It’s dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] ‘Specially with me around.
You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it’s just gonna make you cry?
Because everything makes me cry, so what’s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.
He’s got a bank vault. That’s a start.
Robert California. Let’s have a conversation.
Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-
And when you recount your day, never say you woke up. It’s a waste of your time. That’s how every day’s begun, for everyone, since the dawn of man.
Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I’ve been doing this thing-
Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.
First item on the agenda: can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don’t know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.
Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. [motions her over, both looking at Robert’s notebook]
[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?
The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?
Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women’s soccer, no?
It’s just a list of our names, split into two columns.
Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
No. Okay. Um, I’ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
[throws hard, Jim doesn’t catch] Nice catch.
If he comes out, distract him. [takes list to copier]
We don’t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
I promise you, we don’t need a warning-
WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?
Okay, which side of the list am I on?
Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.
Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert’s notebook.
He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
Oh, okay. I don’t want any part of this.
Maybe it’s a list of people he’s gonna fire.
Okay, it’s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here’s something. Who would eat who in an ‘Alive’ situation. No… that can’t be it.
I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side’s the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.
Shhh, Pam. C’mon, don’t be such a right-sider.
Go in there and just ask the man what it means.
He’ll know that we looked at his private notebook.
C’mon, just say you saw the list by accident.
I’m already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it’s starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.
Yeah, that’s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?
[Andy continuously knocking on door] Yes, for god’s sake Andy. Yes, come in.
What’s up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.
And it was open. And people saw this. And they’re just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.
It’s a photocopy from your notebook.
You read my notebook? And photocopied it. And distributed it.
No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.
Ah, please. Here’s what it is. It’s a doodle.
That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?
Might as well have been sketching a cube.
Okay. Robert’s in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?
Maybe we’re s’posed to do it with people in our group.
Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?
Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ‘em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!
Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]
[enters room, everyone quiets and separates] I’d like to invite the following people to join me for lunch: Jim, Dwight, Angela, Darryl, Kevin, Toby, Phyllis, Oscar.
Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
I love you so much. [starting to cry]
Hey. It’s nothing. Alright? I’ll text you when we get there. Let you know what’s going on.
Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!
Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street?
Oh, I didn’t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
Elmo, god’s sake, it’s the Elmo era.
Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn’t you agree.
Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.
The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
I should not be here. I’m in the- I was in the wrong- I’m- I’m sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.
Well, why don’t you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.
Yeah, well, that’s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.
Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?
Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.
You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question… what made you pick this group?
I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you.
Probably shouldn’t have said that. [Jim’s jaw drops]
Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.
[Pam’s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Jim. “This is getting very weird. Will explain later.”
[Everyone’s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Kevin.
Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn’t the fact that I’m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
C’mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?
[door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it’s over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.
I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.
Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
[spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up “L” to his forehead]
[on the phone, while getting sprayed] Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It’ll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.
When I was a salesman I could just be like “Not my job, not my prob. I’m going to the warehouse to polish my knob.” Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.
Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it’s really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let’s say top-tier and others would be second-tier.
Thank you. Great.  Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you’re talking about?
Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I’m thinking of. Can you clarify that?
I’m not gonna change my list, Andy, and I don’t use ballpoint pens.
I did not know about the sales figures.
Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.
Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.
I like my new group. I liked my old group.
Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we’re gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.
You want a three and half day weekend for Columbus Day?
And you are aware that Columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of Native Americans.
I don’t care. [Robert smiles as Andy exits]
Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.
Alright, I’m gonna go warm up the car.
Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?
I gotta say, I think it’s kinda cool not knowing. It’s like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It’s kinda sophisticated.
I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.]
It’s all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He’s a genius. You guys just don’t get him.
I made a list like this for Congress when I worked in Hollywood in the 50’s, they’re meaningless.
Guys. Really, it’s ok. Everyone has made a really solid first impression, I don’t think there’s any reason for anybody to worry.
I am on the wrong side, and I am freaking out here.
[grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it’s like hoisting a manatee. I can’t get a grip it’s so vast.
Creed! Wha- [Shoves Creed with his foot, Creed grunts] This is a safety issue with you. There’s no way to know if you’re dead!
Good morning. [suitcase falls and he laughs awkwardly]
It’s called owling. You’ll read about it in like eight months.
Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.
Chicken piccata, salad on the side please.
I’ll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.
Side salad, chicken piccata on the side.
I’ll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.
Jim, you alright? What are you doing?
I don’t think we have to do this again cause it’s gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses]
You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.
I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?
Hi, Mr. Shrute. I’ve waited on you before. I just wanted to let you know that gratuity is not included in the bill and tips are expected.
Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl….
My entire childhood, I was the one left out, and I said to myself: Gabe, if you just achieve some success, you’ll be part of them. You’ll be part of the happy ones. But instead, people just used my success as a new way to shut me out.
Hey, this ain’t no Breakfast Club, bitch.
Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
Me feel good.  Body strong.  Sleep big last night.
Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.
Yeah, alright Kev why don’t you come with us?
I mean, he’s gotten worse over the years….
He’s making a statement. It’s an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say “car no go”, and we best friends.  So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?
Kevin, I appreciate what you’re trying to do.
Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code.  And what we’re talking about is…basically the speech equivalent… to just wearing underpants.  Sometimes words, you no need use…but need need for talk talk.
Does it save time though? ‘Cause we’ve been here for about an hour.
Kevin, at most you’re saving a microscopic amount of time.
What are you gonna do with all this time?
Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.
K, Kevin, are you saying “See the world”? or “Sea World?”
See world.  Oceans. Fish.  Jump. China.
No, see? Right there, that’s the problem with your method. ‘Cause I still don’t know if you’re saying “Sea World” or “see the world,” and it’s taking a lot of time to explain it.
When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling]  They see.
This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet….the Pyramid.  [holds up triangle shaped touch pad]
So, you can tell your clients: “Unleash the power of the pyramid.”
Oh no no no.  Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it’s barely three pounds.
How much memory does it have without the booster?
You’re really going to want the booster.
How on earth are we supposed to sell…?
Andy, don’t make us sell this stupid thing.
Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight’s meeting.
I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties…and tie clips.  Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN?
Yeah.  C-SPAN, cocker spaniel.  Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause……
Is this really the best use of our collective time?
I am still forming a first impression with Robert.  Once it is formed, we can all relax.  Ok, I’m sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog…had to pull rank.
[to group] OK, let’s look at some ties.
Here’s how I’m going to help out from now on. I’m going to not care, and I’m going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy’s inevitable demise.
[To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.
Erin, you don’t need to call him that.
Justine.  She said she’s coming by later.
Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?
Well I’m just quoting you.  I would never say that about her.  I don’t know the woman.
Nah man, we get along now.  Real well.
Wow. Alright. Can’t wait to meet her.
Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose.  But last night we put a lot of that to bed.  I can’t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night…. I have to sing it.  [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
[to Robert California] Hi Dad!…… Ahhh….oh boy.
Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you’re here?
I was looking over your projections, and I think we can do better.
Are you factoring in the… whole national …economy…. declining and all that?
I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor….vanilla?
Vanilla? No no no no.  You’ll never guess in a million billion years you’ll never guess.
You were saying you chose me…. There was a reason?
Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set?
Can I inspire? [laughs] I don’t know!…..I don’t know.
I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said “coffee”….
Why don’t we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.
I’ve been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. [sips] Mmm….
You know, we’ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up.  Now we’re in this weird dance….
[interrupting] I’m afraid you’ve lost my interest.
If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?
[chuckling] Oh, you’d go someplace else.  That’s not it, that’s not the answer.
Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it’s birth.  Those superstores are terrified of us.  Anybody know why?
Neither am I, it’s already done.  Hah, I’m just kidding, it’s going to take some time.
Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim’s desk, kicking things in the process.]
What’s up, guys? Just thought we’d have a little rap session, talk about business…see how things are going? Ahem…
If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert…man.  What a boss.  Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how’s the sales doubling …project going?
Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can’t just press a magic button.
OF course not.  There’s no magic button.  You have to summon that.
If we could just double our sales, we already would have.  You’re not making any sense.
He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they’re out of the house.
You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box.  If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.
New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door…
Fart….. good Sesh. [gets up] That leg’s asleep.
Hello. I’m looking for Darryl Philbin?
Don’t! oh, you must think…I’m not. I’m using the fax, this isn’t, no wait.  I’m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There’s usually an Erin here.
[Singing] rub a dub dub…I got scrubbed.  ‘Sup, darlin’? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.
Follow me, I got a space. After you.  I’ve been thinking about you all mornin’.  I don’t know what you did, I can barely walk today.
Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie…?  Lick the spoon?
No, that’s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about…
Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don’t see the point. It’s so Wall Street.
Must be a tough time to be a family farm.
Oh, it is. And beets are not immune.  We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
Oof.  What are you gonna do about that?
There’s gotta be some way you can double your beet sales…
You wanted the job, the job is yours.  Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I’ll do mine….. walnuts?
Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]
Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici’s favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
She looks at it when she’s on the potty, and she makes the faces.
Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you’re pregnant?
I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk.  Would you like to join me?
You don’t have to thank us for coming in, it’s our job.
Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I’m gonna thank people.
These are incentives.  It’s how we’re gonna double growth. Now, you’re probably all asking yourselves: “Well, how does this work?”
Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.
You’re exactly right and you get a point.
I’ve outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.
Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It’s so gross.
There’s lots of stuff.  John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.
How ‘bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.
This point system is really insulting.
Ooh I didn’t mean to offend you, and I hope you’ll forgive me because I am very very… Sari. [tosses yellow print material over shoulder] Sixteen points.
What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
I don’t know, for such a crazy number I’d like something pretty crazy.
Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. [laughter]
That’s pretty good.  What about uh, for a thousand points?
I’ll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. [laughter] Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard![Andy points to his rear-end]
Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?
Swear to God, hope to die. Now let’s get to work!
Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case…let’s get to work.
[on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen’s bananas.
Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?
Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years….and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down.  Now look at him.
[On the phone] You’ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!
You think it has something to do with that incentive program?
Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
Bah…I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.
Nah, you definitely weren’t kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]
Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.]
[on the phone]and I’m back. How are you sir?….I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
Where’s Angela? [Hands paper over her shoulder]
Don’t talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]
Ready! [flips sketch pad showing tattoo possibilities] “I’m not as think as you drunk I am!” [crowd claps and cheers]
I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page]
OK, keep in mind, it’s not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions.  My car [nervous laughter] for a thousand points….or best offer.
Oh, and then this was Phyllis’s idea…[shocked cheers] So nasty Phyllis!
We were hoping you could do something like this…
We should think about this…does anyone have any better ideas?
For sure.  [murmurs from group in agreement]
Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this…
Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ….Confession: I don’t know what I’m doing.
I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun….and you did that.
My ass is only so big, I mean I can’t do this everyday.
But I think it’s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea….which, by the way, I can’t wait for.
No one expects me to go through with this, right?
My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.
Uh, you can keep your pants on actually…if just drop ‘em down a bit, that’d be great.
Well, I think down’s better.  Sweating pretty heavily down there.
Do you think you could work from this? [showing Tattoo artist sketch pad] we made some small adjustments.
Invest in softer cotton, sir. [tattooing begins] OW! Oh! Oooh! [Crowd cheers] oh, whoa!!
Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I’m gonna like it.
Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he’s all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him.
[removes tape to reveal tattoo of puppy] It’s a Nard Dog! [group cheers] That’s my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!
There’s something about an underdog that really inspires…the unexceptional.
Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I’m having.
Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.
A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don’t know if I should call social services about it.
Angela, that’s pretty transparently me.
In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!
Yeah. I think you should call social services.
You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we’re in this together.
Which combo do you think Robert’s gonna like better?
No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options…
Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. They’re for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. It’s like yeah Tucker, you’re so street.
You’re right, you’re right, you’re right. Uh! It’s so hard to find an occasion for this clip.
I’d hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70’s theme party, or a 70’s theme meeting, or a 70’s theme convention…
Hey. Maybe it’d help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.
What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.
What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You’d get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart’s.
Yeah….I don’t think that’s legal. It’s a nice thought though. [Erin hands Andy a gift] What is this?
I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.
You didn’t have to do that. [opens box to reveal red mouse cat toy attached to key chain]
I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don’t know why. I made it into a key chain.
You’re the only person who’s congratulated me.
You can’t leave a dog in a parked car. [points to “I’d rather be snowboarding” bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.
I bet this guy didn’t leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
Well, we don’t know how long the driver’s been gone and it’s not in direct sunlight.
So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?
Here, I’m gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
OK, you know what? I’m gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on.
There you go! Here doggy! He’s not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.
Oh don’t try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.
This guy’s been gone long enough. He’s lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron]
Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! [Oscar busts out back window, group cries out in protest, then cheers]
And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds]
What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
Jim, he’s not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]
Nein. Sits. [snaps as dog calms] Goot.
Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.
Bye! [Kevin’s horn honks twice shortly, then one long honk. Shot shows him passed out on his steering wheel.]
What’s that come to? Like, what did they each win?
Oh man, it’s gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won … playing my birthday.
What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
We’re lookin’ at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing.
I mean, I don’t even know what I’d do with all that money.
I know what you’d do with all that money. [imitating Jim] “Hey Pam, let’s buy expensive bathrobes and hug.”
No, I’d probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I’d either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?
Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?
I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo…
And then every morning, I’d walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting…
Stop. I’m a barista in your fantasy?
Well in your fantasy we’re Stephen King characters.
I don’t know about Stephen King, I mean…
[under her breath] get a divorce…get a divorce…
I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year….I mean obviously I wouldn’t come in till noon and I wouldn’t do anything I didn’t wanna do. I mean I’m getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?
What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
I’m not checkin’ email till lunch. Four hour work week.
Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can’t lose this client.
Alright, well until we have a new crew, let’s get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who’s in? [Erin raises hand]
As long as you guys don’t need me up here.
I think we’ll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement]
Really, nobody’s gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
Of course. I would. But my hip….I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes]
Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you…
Hey…OK no. No. That. You are so not…oh god. [grunts] False. Andy, I will volunteer.
Good old Kevin. He’ll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
Wait, wait. What’s this? [holds up clipboard]
Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby’s birth weight pool.
It says “Lotto Pool”, right on top. [points to obvious title]
Oh come on. You really think I’m gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
I didn’t hire anyone if that’s why you’re here.
I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of ’em. So I’d say we’re in the early stages of the process.
Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?
The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can’t air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
Right. Um, well how ’bout we take a look at some applications? …This guy wrote his in green ink, that’s pretty cool. Check it out. [attempts to give Darryl application who ignores him at first but then takes it]Hey! There ya go…there he is.
That is not Darryl. I don’t know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.
OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That’s seventy-five boxes per person, so that’s not so bad.
Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift]
Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.]
Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl.[no one laughs] What? No Newhart fans? OK…Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?
You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?
Wait, wait. So all the old guys quit?
You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so…
Nope. I’m good. I’m here. Let’s find some warehouse workers.
Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren’t like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they’re gonna realize I don’t know what I’m talking about.
[Grunts while lifting box into truck] What’s the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses]
Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we’re gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.
Don’t just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it’s ten years later and you’re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it’s not gonna change.
I hope so. Think about this carefully. There’s better lives than this one.
I’ve never been lucky. And I’m not talkin’ about the lottery, I’m talkin’ ’bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?
Uh, buying lottery tickets online. [Ryan laughs]
Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
No. Warehouse license….Masters in warehouse sciences?…I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.
No. Not joking. This is real….painfully real, what is happening right now.
[On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I’m not gonna make it. I’m turning back.
There’s gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you’re right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they’re not smart people.
[Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.
It’s a great idea Kev, I don’t think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
[grabbing Kevin’s arm] You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! [Kevin tears up]
Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap? [raises hand and laughs] You’ll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um…
I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn’t help.
What are you talking about? I’m not gonna fire you.
…..OK, this is weird. I don’t, I don’t get the joke.
No? OK. I don’t wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who’s the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.
Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?
It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold’s Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
So. I’ve been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings….
And we move to the south of France. See? No, there’s plenty of bicycling for you. I think that’s where they do the Tour de France.
It is, yeah. I mean I just don’t know why I’m compromising if it’s my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it’s Maine and you love it.
Because I’m never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.
Nope. You’re, you’re doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]
Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?
Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America’s diminishing blue-collar workforce?
North America…and, diminishing is a little reductive, but uh sure. That’s the headline version.
Great….Well, it’ll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.
FYI, Wednesday through Friday I have a pretty full teaching schedule.
Got it. Dually noted. You! [points to Bruce] Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?
So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That’s what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn’t ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.
Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]
So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
And it’s clear we’re not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor]
So sadly, it’s the best idea on the table.
I think we’re ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?
Why? Because you didn’t win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?
I’ll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.
Also, Darryl, FYI, I already told this to Andy, but uh, you should probably know I technically don’t have a hearing problem, it’s just when there’s a lot of noises…
Nate! Please….thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D’Angelo, what happened to that?
He didn’t die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I’d be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven’t asked me about it?
What wa-, what was the last…I’m havin’ a-
None, no part of this has anything to do with you.
I didn’t have time because of my daughter.
Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.
Hey I’m not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
Hey. Here’s the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause]
My future’s not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It’s gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it’s gonna be mostly my bunch.
Yeah. [laughs] That makes sense. OK. Good, alright.
What is goin’ on?! [shot shows greased aisle flanked by rows of boxes]
OK, I can see why you’re angry, you’re coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.
And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it’s cool cause we found another use for them.
OK, alright, that’s…look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
Doesn’t matter what the name is. Señor Loadenstein, that’s stupid.
[laughing] Señor Loadenstein. Tell ’em why it’s called that, Jim.
No, Jim. Tell us why it’s called Señor Loadenstein.
OK. You know what? It’s been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.
Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.
Uno! Dos! Tres! [Shot shows Jim & Dwight pulling ropes attached to a plank holding Erin in a helmet and boxes of paper down the greased runway, Dwight grunts]
I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport.
I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh. [whispers] Flenderson files.
We came to an agreement. We’re going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
Right. It’s city and country combined.
Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
And I can fish right from the window of Pam’s pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
[laughs] Just like now….too bad the schools are terrible.
But what are you gonna do about that?
If I won the lottery, I don’t know. I don’t think I’d make any changes to my life. Quit my job, move, meet someone….
I’d give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can’t cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten’s not gonna make a difference. At some point, you’re just throwing good money after bad.
The first thing I’d buy is new boobs. For my mom. She has the worst boobs. It- It’s embarrassing.
Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we’re basically there.
I know. Kevin, we’ve been friends for a long time, right?
So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-
Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.
I wouldn’t be asking you lightly, now would I?
Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er…
Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?
Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don’t know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck]
That looks good. Back. Whoa whoa whoa!
You’re doing great! A little farther away from the wall!
No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You’re way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.
What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?
What? [Stanley enters office laughing] Morning, Stanley.
There’s this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there’s an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a… phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it’ll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?
Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.
[entering office] Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it.
Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.
Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
Oh, that’s funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO!
Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it’s right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you’ve probably gone too far.
Just give us the address. We’ll look it up online.
I don’t get the reason for this party.
What’s the reason, Andy? What’s the reason?
You don’t need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It’s a garden party. You don’t need a reason.
Few other super simple reminders – no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?
What happens when we’re done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?
I get it, I’m being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all… step it up.
Andy, we understand basic table manners, we’re not children.
This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it’s a garden party.
There’s a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
Aw, ew, please don’t. Not a barbecue. It’s better than a barbecue. It’s dignified, quieter, there are rules.
I’m glad you asked – Connecticut Casual.
Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I’m wearing to your party.
Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother’s promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there’s a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet.
It’s my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn’t really support another harmony part, so… Check it out, that’s my brother’s boss. Look how psyched he is, he’s having an awesome time.
Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
Yeah, of course. Ye… I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did. [groans from the group]
Why didn’t you just say this was to impress Robert California?
I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don’t steal my business strategies, and I won’t dress like my life is just one long brunch?
See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time.
And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
[pointing to computer monitor] So, we’ve typed in the address, now let’s take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]
They don’t warn you when the cameras are driving by.
Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
There’s so much more to it than that.
I’m actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I’ve only sold one copy.
Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
I’ve already gone up another cup size.  The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.
Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don’t, don’t say anything, okay? It’s after my grandfather.
Phillip is the name that we’re using. It’s after my favorite cat.
[giggling] Oh, wow. Funny. It’s after my grandfather.
[on the phone] Andrew, I’ve picked up two possible gifts to bring this afternoon. One, a pot of marmalade.
Well, that, that is what you want then, the marmalade.
You don’t want to hear the other one. You love marmalade.
You know, the marmalade sounds great.
I also mentioned the marmalade to my sister and she’s very interested.
Well, you clearly want the marmalade. Gretchen, I need another marmalade. Alright. [hangs up]
I’m the valet. You have to give me your car.
Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself.
I’m the… I’m the valet. You have to give me your car.
Get out. Have a good time at the thing.
It’s a little tricky, you might have to… take… [Mose speeds away]
Chapter 2 – Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!
Andy, stop hovering, you’re being really annoying.
Didn’t mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you’re able, keep your elbows off the table.
MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!
Technically FOR Robert California. He’s our CEO.
You said you were running the company.
This branch, I’m the regional manager.
Yes, that makes more sense. Are you all regional managers?
Uh, yeah, we don’t have too long, we have theater tickets.
I didn’t know you were going to be here.
Oh, hey, how are you doing, I’m Jim.
Tuna, right? And this must be your lovely wife Pam [looking at Meredith].
Sir, I need to be able to feed all the guests.
Set that down. [grabs waitress] Present yourself.
Chapter 4 – One of the host’s most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!
Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad.
Andy, where shall I put your basil plant?
Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade.
This is not funny, man, let me down.
It’s not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn’t make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.
Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That’s my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity.
Let’s hear from you guys, who do you want to toast?
Yeah, I’ll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts]
I can’t believe I didn’t think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley’s mistress?
I would like to toast someone who isn’t here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!
I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!
She just always has to copy anything I do! It’s the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
I’d like to make a toast to the troops.  All the troops.  Both sides.
Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.
Chapter 9 – The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,…
You can’t triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.
I’ll say a few words if that’s alright with you, Andy.
To Robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you…
Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage!
Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets? [starts playing guitar]
Oh, whoa, sure? Really? It’s a little tricky.
[singing] Saying I love you is not the words…
Here, give it to me. Okay. Uh, something like… [singing] Saying I love you is…
You don’t come in yet. [singing] …I want to hear from you, It’s not that I want you…
…not to say it but if you only knew… More than words is all you have to do to make it real…
Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin!
[holding up cell phone] It’s either taping or calling.
What would you do if my heart was torn in two…
You know what, Walter Jr. is here. Why don’t you come up and join us?
Dad, no. I’m just having a good time getting to know Andy’s friends here.
Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you’ll never be able to sing again. Woo!
[singing] May the good lord be with you down every road you roam. And may sunshine and happiness surround you when you’re far from home. And may you grow to be proud, dignified and true. And do unto others as you’d have done to you…
[applauds] Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar.
If you’d like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
That’s because you didn’t bring a jacket.
My first love is beet farming, but it’s a young man’s game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?
Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here.
Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me?
I can get you exotic meats – hippo steaks, giraffe burgers…
Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I’d very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn’t even my worst sales call.
I don’t know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you’d be proud of me.
I know, I know that you’re proud of me.
I think if I had parents like that I’d be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.
It’s a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn’t explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.
Different school of thought. Let’s just agree to disagree.
My body has somehow become acclimated to southern Italy. Isn’t that strange? I’ve never been there! Oh, ah, yes, that’s nice. Thank you.
It was a nice party, the setting was a little strange. Uh, the food…
Hey everybody, I’m gonna leave and I just wanted to say I’m really sorry.
I think I left my wallet in your house.
I didn’t forget them, they’re right here.
I’m so sorry, I think I forgot that thing…
Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
That’s a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!
I cannot believe how condescending Andy’s being.
He gets condescending when he’s nervous. Or when he’s excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.
Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I’m a lady. I’m a mother. I’m a former boxer!
Hey guys, getting psyched for the party? Ryan? Can I count on you to wear an understated satirical outfit?
Can’t wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment’s at 9%. I wouldn’t miss it for the world.
Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors d’oeuvres and the animals on Noah’s ark?
With Hors d’oeuvres we only take one at a time.
Oh, OK. What’s the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?
Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.
When all this is over, I’d like to actually go to one of Trickington’s parties, they sound like a blast.
Ladies and Gentlemen! I present to you…the Alamo! [reveals lump of ice]
Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn’t even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It’s just something you do to a hole!
Well I’m having my baby first, so that’s that.
You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I’ll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.
You think your doctor’s going to give you a C-section at six months?
Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.
My parents are used to a certain type of class. The people that I work with are a different type of class. One is not better than the other, it’s just that maybe one’s a little higher than the other?
I’ve decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules – don’t be offensive, don’t be cliche, and don’t take the first two rules too seriously.
The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
Ah, it’s, uh… somebody’s already called that.
Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow.
This is ridiculous! Why can’t there just be two Kate Middleton’s?
Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It’s like, I can’t choose. They’re both amazing. It’s just…
Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn’t even here.
Because I was there. [shows Kelly her cell phone video] Your the people’s princess! Diana was nothing!
I thought you were at your sister’s funeral.
What I said was, “My sister’s funeral is this weekend.” Didn’t say I’d be there.
Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it.
When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don’t mention one of the best parts. After you’re done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
[to Kelly] If you get into season 1, you can really…
[Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It’s all Toby’s fault.
Every Halloween I tell him the same thing – You can’t bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing – As soon as I get my weapons back I’m gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I’m a lucky turkey.
Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I’m not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just… wanna make sure this is the best we can do?
I just got a text from Broccoli Rob – “Boo!” Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California – “Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high.” Scared the s**t out of me.
G’day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me?
[faxing, Erin watching over her shoulder] What are you doing?
Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you’re doing something I don’t.
That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he’s like, fax these documents, please. The next he’s like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin’s feeling, right?
Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?
That’s like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.
No, I mean, you’re doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?
Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can’t deny.
Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.
…and he said, That’s what everyone sees, that’s the Man In Black.
No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
Mmhmm. No, but what I’m saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.
Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
I don’t know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.
Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we’re under a Jack attack!
Yes, Andrew. And you, on this day of fantasy, are a laborer.
Everyone, this Bert, my son. Bert, this is… a paper company.
Hello. Can I use a computer? I need to check a hurricane.
Here, use this one. [walking to Jim’s desk]
Oh, look, Pin The Wart On The Wench. How did you know I was bringing my son?
Oh, I didn’t. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?
Well, perhaps this party will awaken the baby in all of us.
Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We’re still getting it set up, it’s gonna be really cool.
[laughing] Extraordinary. Did you plan this?
And I overheard, and thought, hey, that’d be fun, don’t mind if I do.
If you turn out the lights we’ll do a little dance.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we’re the skeleton crew.
Just fine, Kelly? Everything alright?
You guess? So, there is something you want that you do not have.
Because it’s too terrifying to imagine. Now we’re cooking. What is it, Kelly? What is this great fear of yours?
Yes. Dying alone, that is very scary. And how are you, Toby?
I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
I don’t know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so…
Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?
So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
Very low pressure in the Sargasso Sea, warm air from South America, cold air from Greenland. All signs point to the perfect storm.
I’m a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
If you had some really big wings with blades on the end, you’d kind of look like Kerrigan from Starcraft.
Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I’ve been censored.
If you’re going to be a Zerg, at least be a Lurker, not some girl.
Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!
November’s sure creeping up, ain’t it? Can’t stop that month!
Hey, what’s the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?
Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG.
But that’s it? There’s nothing about me, or I?
Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.
[pretending to be on the phone] Yes. [laughs] I don’t know. Mmhmm.
I’m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little.  I think it could use some extra pizazz.
Remember that Halloween party you took me to once?  The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn’t stop crying?
Ok.  Let’s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one.  Just… more adult… more…  scary and sexy
I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine.
No – just scary.  If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
[laughs, eventually Erin joins him laughing] Oh that would be scary!
Hey it’s Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because I’ve read a lot about this really great documentary.
It didn’t have a buster sign around him?  Why don’t you draw him?  Why don’t we see this whole thing.
Ok fine I’ll draw him. [hangs up phone and draws]
I ain’t fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!
Mmhmm.  Dwight are you eating a stick?
That’s really rude.  I don’t tell you hurricanes suck even though it’s true.
Oh yeah?  What’s the vaccine you can take to avoid a hurricane?
Open up a newspaper.  Oh look a hurricane’s coming.  I suppose you’re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
[to Kevin] You seem unimpressed.  Ghosts don’t scare you?
I’m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers.  Not things that don’t exist like ghosts or mummies.
Mummies are real.  There are mummies at museums.
It’s true.  They’ve been preserved for thousands of years.  They’re all over.
[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
I grew this party up real fast.  Get out of here little kid party.  Nobody loves you.  And clean up your room!  Grownups are going to use it later!  Oooh!
Party looks fun doesn’t it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
I’m using it.  I’m about to play Starcraft with him [points to Dwight].
Pam do you think anyone’s going to notice I’ve worn this costume before?  When I wasn’t pregnant.  You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
Hey guys.  I’m an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying “Representative Weiner] weiner.
This party’s tight.  The fog is cool.
It really looks great.  You did a great job.
Oh, so we don’t have to have that talk.
We should still have that talk.  Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45? [Erin nods] Cool.
The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement.  The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea.
[cuts back to a Happy Birthday cake gushing blood when cut into, a doll melts, a woman eats food and puckers her face] Is that my grandmother?
Yeah it seems like there isn’t a narrative. [on screen a man gets into a car]  Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting.
I think we’ve seen enough.  You can turn it off now.  [everyone murmurs agreement] Yeah turn it off now.
Where is this from?  That is so upsetting!
That was awful.  Robert I apologize.
I’m sorry.  I got confused.  I heard you wanted to make the party more adult.  But I think I know what to do now [grabs box].  This game is called “pecker Poker”.  [fighting tears] It’s the game of cards that gets you hard.
What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.
Why didn’t you simply ask Andy to clarify?  Asking is a very easy thing to do.  You’re obviously very close. [Andy and Erin look awkwardly at each other and Robert].  Oh I see.  This no longer seems like my business [Robert sits].
All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so…
You were going to talk at the end of the… I’m not here.
Did you think I was going to fire you?  No I wasn’t.  [to Robert] I’m sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.
Ok.  Erin I think you know I’ve been dating someone.
And it’s getting a little more serious.  She’s never come by.
And she’s never called here.  Unless it’s your mom.
No I didn’t want her to call because I thought it would be weird.  But now it’s weird that she’s not calling.
Wow.  I’m so happy for you guys.  Um let me know when you get to forty.  I’ll see you guys.
I just don’t get it, Pam. I mean, you’re a rational person.
Jim doesn’t let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?
Careful, whoa. First of all, it’s not like I think that’s going to help the Eagles win.
No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It’s not…
You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.
I don’t know. She’s from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.
Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend’s from the forest?
I don’t know, Phyllis. Maybe she’s from the city.
Looks terribly real, doesn’t it, Creed?
You don’t live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby.
[in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.
[talking to Robert] Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps.
Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, “Mom, there’s a ghost in my closet.” Now, you say one of two things – one, “You’re just having a bad dream,” or two, “Let’s go see what it was.”
The crib was full of dirt. Baby struggled to free itself from underneath, reaching and clawing, gasping for air. Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi, lurching toward baby, for they were mummies.
Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry…
I’m the CEO’s son. Pack your things. You’re done.
I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
Ok, I met him in a bar, right? There’s something weird about him. He doesn’t smell right, the clothes are all tattered and dirty and from another age. Anyways, we end up back and my place and we go at it all night-
No, no. I’m very comfortable with all things sexual. Continue.
I wake up the next morning, all my stuff’s gone. Whole house turned over. No trace. You tell me what happened.
Have you considered the possibility that you slept with a drifter?
I’m a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.
I’m a zombie from Walking Dead. It’s a show.
Uh, I know what it is. Ok? I have like a thousand people over every week to watch it. Ok? We all kinda hate it though.
If ghosts are real, how come everyone knows what they look like? It’s not like a bunch of people got together and agreed on a lie.
Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, there’s some sort of real phenomenon out there…
This isn’t about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.
Pam, this is important. Was he me? Am I him?
But that would make more sense. [Pam sighs]
Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over.  Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day.  It’s weird.
One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.
Uh no it’s W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that’s what you are hearing.
[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
Let’s see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I’ve heard ‘Closing Time’ a hundred and five times. [nods and shakes head] Still don’t know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.
[singing] Closing time every new beginning…
I’ve never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it’s time to go home. Now…it’s my favorite song.
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
[speaking at the same time as andy] This is atrocious.
The ticketing software paints a picture of a sloppy, careless, error prone office.
Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes…
[runs in and interrupts] Sorry, go ahead.
[to dwight] Did you need something from us?
Wha…Yes. Your attention. Uh because… No that is all. [walks out]
Last week an accounting mistake resulted in a client getting their order for free.
Umpf…that’s not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.
They’re both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture…
Andrew sometimes I feel like you don’t know me at all.
When I come back next week and this report shows me no mistakes, we can talk about names, all day. Our favorite names, silly made up names, normal names said in a silly voice. Wouldn’t that be nice?
End the mistakes. That is all I ask. [gets up from chair] And you can’t have a favorite Iron Chef. It depends entirely on the secret ingredient. Sometimes I feel you don’t know food at all.
I’m just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby’s in a really good place now. So…my pitch is…me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.
Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today.
Ahh…We don’t really do those. We just sign the thing.
Yeaha…yup. [awkward silence then points to door] Just trying to get in.
I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I’ve been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.
[opens folder] Allow me. You’re going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh…should’ve used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else’s work.
Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
Do not go there! You’re the deuce I never want to drop.
Well, I can make this work. I’ll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
Go do the voodoo that you do so well.
Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship.
Whom I’m seeing is Val from down in the warehouse.
I’m not technically seeing her, but uh I’ve seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So..[holds up fist]
You know I don’t have to do the paperwork unless you’re actually dating.
Ok, but once this starts, it’s going to be moving fast. It’s going to be hot and heavy and I don’t want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know?
But I mean…uh have you talked to her? Is sh…
Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays…
Toby I’m going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she’s going to be screaming it tonight.
She’s going to be screaming her own last name?
Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really.
And I’d like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call…Dwight…
The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you’re out.
If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.
Robert’s favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn’t strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.
Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
Jim, you’re trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.
Um, no we’re not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.
[Everyone angrily disagreeing]Smile…nod. Smile and nod.
They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like…not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor…
Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.
But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.
Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha.
This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me.
There’s an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I’ll send an order down to shipping before we’ve received payment.
[alert goes off] Oh, there’s one mistake.
Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
Dwight’s our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I…
It’s not a doomsday device, gosh. [Erin makes red strike on desk] We can do this you guys.
It’s for protecting my ass. When you suckers lift more than you can handle. Sup, I’m Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don’t be nervous.
Apparently we have a visitor. Gabe, everyone.
All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn’t get much use nowadays.
I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown. Considering that’s the only thing I know about her. I will be milking that hard. [Gestures milking a cow]
It’s like a hula hoop. Right. Mele Kalikimaka is the wise way.
The Michelin man called, he wants his cummerbund back.
Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.
Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.
Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.
Oscar, use a calculator. [Oscar shakes head]
When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it’s powered by thai food and spanish reds. [points to his head]
Alright everybody, you are doing great!
Well, I wouldn’t say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she’s hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger]
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
I haven’t even considered it. That’s how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like…z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha…You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won’t even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.
Once you read the packet, sign the back.
Actually, Val, why don’t you come with? I’ll need the extra hands to carry them back.
Mmhmm. [points at gabe] Caramel soy latte.
You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no.
What does this mean? What does it mean!
[pulls out Brandy bottle] Well…I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today.
It goes out automatically at five P.M.
Well, th- There’s gotta be a way to stop it.
Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.
You don’t deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
No you didn’t, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?!
You’re a real crumb bum, you know that?
Hey, you can’t just change the rules because you don’t like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?
Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.
Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down!
Good luck finding a new job idiots. I’ll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.
Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.
Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.
Uh, he’s at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.
[digging] Oh. Come to reason with me?
Gotcha something. [gives Dwight cap, Dwight throws it aside] And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-
What does it look like I’m doing? Digging a grave for a horse.
Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in]
If you hit another horse, you’ve dug to far.
I’ll see you next week Will. [at the club, playing squash]
Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
Are you okay, Kevin? [Kevin gives thumbs down]
Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.
Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.
Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.
This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.
That’s too much Doodle and not enough Lab.
Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that’s just Lab?
So, tonight I was thinking, I’m gonna go to the cemetery. I’m gonna drink a little wine and I thought maybe you’d like to come with me.
Because I don’t date coworkers. It’s not personal, it’s a matter of policy.
Don’t quit. [Darryl eavesdropping, nods]
Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.
In the box. [hits it straight into the floor]
Why haven’t we heard anything? It’s 4:45. There’s only 15 minutes left.
Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago ‘A Beautiful Mind’-
I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones’ signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy]
[Kevin comes around corner with a pan, ready to strike Dwight, Pam shakes her head] Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.
Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody’s nerfect, right?
Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It’s “Nobody’s perfect.” Nice stroke, Pam.
No. It’s a jokey saying. Pobody’s nerfect, like I can’t even say those words right. Ha.
I hadn’t heard that before, that’s, that’s funny.
Dwight, there’s just a small matter of a-
You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.
Just don’t talk about the email, okay? He’s gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.
Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning.
Sive drafely. [Pam points back at him, smiling]
Isn’t it supposed to be, “Drive safely”?
[a text tone goes off] Is that my phone?
Nah, I think it’s mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.
Well, it’s mine. You took it out of my bag.
Whoa, no, wait, wait, wait, whoa. [tries to catch it with racket, misses, lands on floor]
It’s the standard one. The one everyone has.
Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
It depends Jim. Do you find one-day only Jet Blue sales to Buffalo interesting?
Ha ha. No, I don’t. No, I don’t. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]
[her text tones rings] Dwight stopped the device!
Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs.
[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]
Let’s not make any mistakes today. Or at least no more than four.
This doomsday device sounds like a scare tactic to me. Y2K all over again.
This could be real. Dwight’s pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.
Ok, he didn’t fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.
No- Ok. Well, we’ll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?
I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80’s movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don’t do that, I think I’ll be alright.
[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?
Why? Not only are you terrible at squash, but you don’t even seem to enjoy it. Jim, this is not enough of a challenge for me.
Well, that is… because you didn’t realize that… I was left-handed.
Well Darryl, considering that I basically own the place, I’m just chillin’ at mi casa. This is me, in repose..I suppose.
You know, there’s this expression: Bro’s before Ho’s. And what that’s short for is brothers before whores. Uh, I don’t buy that. I would throw any brother under the bus for any whore. Woman.
Robert, do you wanna smoke pipes during our meeting?
Let’s wait, until we have something to smoke about.
Yes. Of course. [whispers] Erin..[throws pipes at Erin]
Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate…
Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all…
Yeah. I’m still figuring out the two man bobsled here, so let’s hold off on the D-man for now.
In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I’m not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.
Nobody. Just say that I’m-  Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I’m going to refuse to take it.
Just make up a phone call. It’s not a real call. Make it up.
And come and tell me. Doesn’t matter what it is.
I’m not going to take it. And then he’s going to be like “whoa this is a really important meeting”.
Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I’ll tell you how we can beat it.
I’m sorry – I’m with a very important client. It’ll have to wait.
Are you sure? It’s really, really important.
There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.
Really? Because your mother is dead.
She’s not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.
This isn’t one of those times. It’s the police. They said it’s the worst they’ve ever seen.
Andy I’m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
[on phone]It’s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.
That stuff can come back to get you. It’s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle…
Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?
How’s it going? Everything make sense?
I think everything is under control.
No I should go fill out my paperwork.
Ok [squeaking sound] Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.
I’m training a temp to be my replacement while I’m on maternity leave. Oh I should’ve mentioned I’m pregnant. You probably didn’t notice because it’s impossible to tell I’m so small. But yeah I’m pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on!
Hey – asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we’d save her from Ryan right?
I’m delivering it from the fridge. It’s like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?
Yeah and we’re not about to make love. I just thought maybe you’d want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.
I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
Uh you tell me [Kevin playing drums with chicken legs]
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
Well he’s probably a drug dealer. That’s the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow.
It’s going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.
Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
It’s going to be good to have someone hot at Pam’s desk huh?
I’m kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She’s obviously super cute I get it. But I’d like to point out there’s 50 pounds more of me to love if that’s your thing.
Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.
It’s one of the most common fetishes.
You know it’s not just pregnant women who don’t get their due. You know who’s gorgeous? Helen Mirren.
Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It’s a pregnant Helen Mirren.
Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you’re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That’s right. You’re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
[scatting] Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray.
Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.
Not bad fellas, you’re better than you look.
[sees Robert California enter] Hey Robert, are we meeting early?
Just taking a stroll. What exactly have I stumbled upon here?
Well we’re all musicians and we play together sometimes.
Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!
Tambourine? You know I’m the CEO, right?
[to Kevin] CEOs don’t play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.
I play harmonica. I think I have one in the car.
Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!
I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you’re in a rock and roll band with somebody, you’re bonded for life!
Usually that life is short and tragic. That’s okay, right?
I’m not asking if you’re in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?
Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.
Okay. Uh, I don’t. So are we good? [Jim leaves]
Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.
Why would I or anyone else think that you’re hot right now? I can’t impregnate you, and that’s the driving force between male-female attraction.
What about before? Was I attractive before?
Meh… you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you’re at an all-time low.
Hmm. I think Jim’s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
You think Jim’s lying? [laughs] That’s so cute. I know he’s lying.
Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.
If we’re going to work together, we need some ground rules.
Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.
Well, what does that… is that… okay.
So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
Let’s just see how we feel when we get there.
Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don’t want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.
It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy’s hot.
[to the keyboardist, Curtis, and the drummer] Hey, you found us!
Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is Curtis Dorough, local musician and the officiate at my wedding.
Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
[to drummer] Dude, you’re on TV! You’re the sportscaster on channel seven.
Guys, I’ve got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and güiro]
Hey, why don’t you and me play those?
Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
[singing] Have you heard about the midnight rambler? [Lisa, the guitarist, enters] Hey, come on in, baby. Yeah!
Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.
I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?
Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
Hey, who’s this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?
Yeah, ’cause his mom’s car’s probably not a Nissan Z.
I mean, I guess he’d be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he’ll get hair plugs.
I don’t think Jim cares about his hair.
Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It’s called being a nice person.
I don’t see what’s so ugly about him. He’s got the broad face of a brewer.
Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.
Just ugly enough to have deniability.
Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I’m in the clear. If that wasn’t for the matchmaker test, then… Cathy, he’s a really nice guy.
Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can’t lie with his body.
I’m gonna write something mean on his wall.
The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.
Psst. We’re not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed]
I can’t tell. It’s unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
No. Maybe he just said something funny.
Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.
Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I’m slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim’s crotch]
Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight’s hands away] Wha- Jim.
Aw, cramp, I’m just- [grabs Jim’s crotch again]
Dwight! [pushes Dwight’s hands away] Why?
I’m sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.
[to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.
Why was he making her laugh so much?
[to Jim] Oh, that line from Zoolander?
It was from a deleted scene so we were both right.
Um, do I hand in my expense reports to a particular accountant or-
Why won’t you just admit that she’s attractive? It’s kind of annoying that you won’t say it.
Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that’s where we are now.
She called it crazy? Aw, man, that’s insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.
Yeah, its nuts. But I don’t know what else to do.
Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.
Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?
[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?
I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.
Well, we are playing. We’re all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It’s a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]
[mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.
This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.
Why don’t you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I’m going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?
Wait, that’s it? That’s the question you’re going to ask him?
We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
You have to share the machine with others.
[mimicking] Well, that’s what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.
Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.
Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
‘Cause, uh, my body’s starting to get bruised.
Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?
We had to leave because of creative differences.
Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn’t really fit in with our thing.
Guys, this means they’re Kevin and the Zits now.
Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?
Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he’s lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?
Look at the numbers. Every single time, it’s come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.
Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.
Doesn’t your dad have high blood pressure?
When was the last time you went to the doctor?
It’s important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-
Dwight, stop. I’m not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?
Okay, easy. Trust me, I’m around for the long-haul.
It’s not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.
Come on, let’s go. I wanna call your doctor.
Doesn’t it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?
Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It’s okay.
Oh, is it okay with you? Because if it’s not, you work for me, so… Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and contracts governing our business. Be honest, fair-
And trustworthy in all your business activities and relationships. Treat one another-
Oh! I’m going into labor! Oh my goodness!
Oh okay, she’s going into labor. Make way, everybody!
I know it’s wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it’s necessary.
[after Angela gives her a stack of files]: I’m going into labor!
Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
Hey guys, uh, can’t keep saying you’re going into labor. Everyone knows you’re full of it.
I’m really in labor! This is happening!
Okay guys, here we go! We’ll see you!
Goodbye! Good luck! [empty bottle falls to the ground]
[on the phone] What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it’s like a war out there.
I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I’m turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America’s bloodiest battle.
Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?
[gags, coughs] Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-
Okay, Andy, we get it. It’s a trip to Gettysburg.
That sounds super inspiring! I’m in!
Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [scoffs] Whatever. I’m over it. It’s just grossly irresponsible.
Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?
Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese.
You know, it’s the same as the kosher option. There’s a lesson in there. I mean, I can’t force you to go. You’re not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But… who’s coming with me?
Guess I’m a sucker for historical fiction.
Anyone who’s not going, you’re dead to me. You’re uninvited. I don’t want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge.
Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin’s head]
And- oh. You missed your head. [laughs and puts hat on Jim’s head] There you go. Phyllis, think fast!
All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns’ Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War.
You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.
Ooh. Isn’t that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
It’s just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper’s birthplace, I’d be the first one suggesting it. I’d be rooting for it.
Limitless! Limitless! Limitless! Limitless!
Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you’ve got to get the fire pit.
I can’t get a fire pit. I have two babies.
Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.
Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
Well, I was hoping to talk out some ideas with Andy. But what we have here… is perhaps better. By not going on the trip, you’ve shown you’re the free-thinkers of the office.
Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I’m not even a sheep. I’m on the freaking moon.
So, here what we can do. Game changers- changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again. Everyone, brainstorm some innovations. Don’t be afraid to get weird with it. Meredith! [wakes her up] Excited!
All right! We’re here. Limitless can wait.
Fun fact. In France, they call Limitless ‘The Man with Many Capabilities.’
Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.
Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
Yeah, we’re not going to the visitor center. We’re not tourists.
No, of course we’re not tourists. We’re just people that aren’t from here who are taking a tour.
Unless you’re going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.
After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch.
Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you’re talking about D.P.A., that’s deaths per acre…
…nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.
Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
Dwight, what are you telling this girl?
Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn’t know any better.
Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would’ve believed everything he said.
No, no, no! You’re filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I’m telling the truth.
Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
Really? Why don’t you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
Okay, I will. I don’t know who that is, but I’m gonna tell you this-
Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?
Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.
I am so eager to hear your game-changers. Let’s dig in, shall we?
This idea hasn’t gripped me. What else did you come up with?
Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
The situation you described, returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine, is not one I’m familiar with.
[murmurs] Thought it was worth a try.
That’s fascinating. Tell me, what’s the significance of the peach orchard, thought?
Oh, well, that’s a great question. Actually some of the most-
Excuse me, I got a question for you.
Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?
Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
We don’t need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we’re going. Giddy up! Tallyho!
[taps Gabe’s shoulder] Are you Lincoln?
Hey! Lincoln’s starting. [light applause]
Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I’m, uh, I’m actually with a tour group myself, so- [laughter] Hello! I’m Abraham Lincoln! Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny. [laughter]
Um, excuse me. I’m gonna go to the bathroom.
At this point, when you’re this pregnant, it’s kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.
Kevin, you’ve been quiet. I’m curious to know what your game-changer is.
Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that ’cause they think A-1’s the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That’s where the eyes go. So…
Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a ‘for instance.’
Who else agrees with Kevin, that we’re wasting facilities, manpower, on our underselling products when we should be pushing our top-performers? [everyone raises their hand, Robert laughs] There you go. Consensus.
Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
[as Lincoln] I just don’t understand. It’s 1865, victory is ours, I’ve saved the very soul of our nation, and yet… happiness eludes me. Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits.
‘Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I’ve seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that… [scoffs] like, forget it.
Interesting. So what is Dunder Mifflin’s oatmeal cookie? What is the product that no one wants?
how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
That’s the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic. [laughs]
By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
Let’s talk about food for a second. Food for thought.
Yeah, that’s what I had for breakfast and I think that’s probably why I’m still hungry.
Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.
Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?
Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.
Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!
Spangler Springs is a mile this way.
Oh wow.  So that’s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
I don’t think I should walk anymore.  You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast.  Two poached eggs.  And then half a sandwich on the bus.
Alright fine.  You know what – I guess this place just hasn’t rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would.  I’m still going.  And I’m not going to ask anymore.  I’m not even going to look back.  I’m just going to assume that you’re with me.
[Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren’t going to look back.
And why is Black Rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared?
Right.  I mean you’re an accountant.  Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane.
Dwight – this is one of the archivists here.  I thought maybe we could consult him.
Well.  Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
Schrute Farms did you say?  That is a fascinating little chapter of the Civil War.
YES!  Ha!  Prepare to be refuted!  Go on.
Families and sweethearts back home waited desperately for letters from the front.
Dearest mother I’m sorry it has been so long since my last letter.  It is three months since I arrived at Schrute Farms and I fear I may never leave this place alive.  Melvin Fifer Garris.
But the Battle at Schrute Farms was no battle at all.  It was a code used by pacifists from both North and South who turned the Pennsylvania farmhouse into an artistic community and a refuge from the war.
Wow.  This is so much better than the story you made up.
You’re right.  There should be a monument to this.
Never trust a cookie with a woman’s name.  Pecan Sandy.  Lorna Doone.  Madeline.  They’ll just break your heart.
Robert I hate to interrupt.  But I would love to pitch you one last idea.  I call it the Big Mac idea.
Big Mac idea.  That sounds encouraging.
It’s really, really good Robert.  Let me explain.
No!  This is not fair!  This is my idea.  He’s trying to steal it because he’s jealous of me.
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside.  Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac.  And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.
Oh my.  It was just actually cookies the whole time?
You guys came.  Where’s everyone else?
Back at the bus.  We were locked out.  Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there.  I guess he follows orders.
Yeah sorry everyone else didn’t come.  I think they’re just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.
Even without an audience you’re still at it.
Our office has a disease.  And it goes by many names.  Sarcasm.  Snark.  Wisecracks.  You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes.  That’s what you did with this trip.
They just didn’t turn out how I wanted.  In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.
Haha! There he is. You mind lending a hand? I’m typing up a memo to share your ideas with the board.
For some reason, my boss is obsessed with cookies. It’s not my specialty. My specialty is pizza. But I’m flexible.
Isn’t Gettysburg like three hours away?
No. It’s like two hours and forty-six minutes.
It’s kind of a haul, so we should probably get going. And tuna, I made a special sandwich for you, guess which kind.
Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.
I’m excited, I’ve actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I’m older now, I can outrun a zombie.
Getting everyone on the bus, check. Giving everyone hats, check. Sexiest eastern European girls, uh, check.
Hey, Devil’s Den is that way, we should check it out. That’s where the snipers hid.
Please! Everyone and their mother goes to Devil’s Den. It’s the Olive Garden of Gettysburg.
Well, I meant that in a bad way. Obviously it tastes good, but it’s not cool.
Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
I know what you guys are all thinking right now: Hey, let’s go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Joke’s on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.
Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn’t hurt to have a smile on your face, either.
That’s weird, if it’s not locked, why isn’t it opening?
Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I’m gonna find him.
And that’s how the printing press was invented.
[enters office doing Michael Jackson impression] Everybody beat it. Don’t beat it, stay where you are.
There you are. Dillinger Graphics said their shipment is late.
That it’ll be the first shipment out today.
That is exactly the right thing to say! Do it! Git-er-done! Phyllis, you just married Joe Order, you’re new name is Phyllis Order [fill this order], get it?
Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.
Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you’re in a suicide cult.
No. No. No. You’re way off on that one.
Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
Hey guys let’s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight’s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he’s never, ever going to go back on it right?
[jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey.
Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again]
[to Angela] Thank you so much. [hums]
[sees a pole poking out Dwight’s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight’s wallet]
What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
Prank! [throws money from Dwight’s wallet on the floor]
You know what it’s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
I could, but I just don’t feel like it loser.
I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]
[signing his name] Andrew… Baines… Bernard.
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it’s like taking a test, but I know the answers.
I don’t know. He wasn’t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn’t hire his wife.
That’s why my foundation – The Dream for a Wish Foundation – is going to put them out of business. They’re not going to know what hit them.
Everyone. I’d like to introduce my wife Mrs. Robert California. Mrs. California this is everyone.
Last night at dinner Susan and I were talking about her returning to work. So she’s here today to see if there’s a good fit. Something tells me it just might work out. This is Andy Bernard the regional manager.
Andy would you be so kind as to show Susan around the office. Show her the various departments. Find a place where she’ll shine.
I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We’re 100 percent staffed up.
Andy. Let’s see if there’s a good fit first. Then we’ll talk.
You don’t have to say it if you’re doing it.
[laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
Well today’s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute’s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
Your path from obesity begins right here!
Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.
Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.
Well it was really nice to meet you Brian.
Reception. Your classic one-man operation.
Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.
Two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. Certainly worth exploring; wouldn’t you agree Andy?
Good. It seems like you have this under control. So I’ll just duck out and run the company for a while.
Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let ‘er rip. What do you hate about this place?
Well it’s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
Maybe you do. Hi. I’m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It’s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
Well it’s not that easy. It’s kind of sometimes difficult.
It’s the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.
I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.
You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.
Dwight why don’t you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.
Maybe over a beer after she’s closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].
Well make that a red wine and I’ll tell you my animal rankings [makes gun click noise back].
Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I’m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
Darryl… [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire]
I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping.
But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.
Uh I could work in customer service. HR even.
Are you telling me that there’s no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands?
I am the CEO and I am telling an employee of mine what to do.
Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-
Robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there’s no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don’t we just let it go.
No. Absolutely not. Andrew there must be something you can do. Think.
I would be eternally grateful. It’s not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one.
We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello?
Hold one finger up to Susan. You’ll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, “are you taking your medicine?”
Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it. [Robert and Andy hang up phones]
You didn’t say goodbye to your grandma.
Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute’s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
All I need is another gym. As if I don’t have enough drama.
We have a gym at home. It’s called the bedroom.
Who’s spotting who? Don’t use the bike in the corner. That’s Bruce’s. Jeremy says…
I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
That’s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.
Did you bring your passport with you?
Who walks around with their passport?
Well, I do. Always ready for adventure.
[sees Susan is busy in the annex] Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn’t want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.
Andy, if he didn’t want her working here then why did you hire her?
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
How can we do that? She’s simply wonderful.
It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you’re up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.
Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler]
Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don’t have a computer.
Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I’m gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don’t. Know.
No, I don’t think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it’s doing.
[grabs phone] Aw… He’s so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
That’s adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
Excuse me, waiter, there’s a dog in my soup. [Jim chuckles]
[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I’m sorry, I’ve got to recharge this.
I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss’ wife. Of course, she was married to Robert.
Your employees don’t seem to be taking to me.
Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We’ll fix this.
[chuckles] Please. Andrew, my wife… has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you’ll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night.
Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don’t you?
It’s okay. I understand. I’m not sure how I would feel about having the boss’ wife work for me either.
Let’s just say that if you don’t want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.
Why would you not want me working here?
I think I understand what you’re going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can’t he?
Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn’t he?
I build you this temple to the human body, and you’re lifting what, five pounds?
I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
Dude, I’m gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I’ll start slow.
Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I’m gonna make you look like Lebron James!
Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here.
Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.
Where did this come from? Did Andy say that?
No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him.
What’s the struggle? He made a great call, hired a great person.
Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me.
Okay, enough of this. I mean, really, enough. It’s gotten way out of hand. Andrew, this is my wife. Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, I thank you for. But it is not welcome right now. Just be honest.
Why do you keep looking at my husband?
Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, “in four seconds, my wife’s gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.” [laughs]
No, it’s not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.
Let’s get Jim in here. [Jim shoves out of fram in his chair, Robert looks for Jim] Where’s Jim?
Can you call security, tell ’em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this.
[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open… uh, okay. [runs]
[sees Jim’s abandoned car] That’s weird. Well, he’s gotta be around here somewhere.
[shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?
This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
Yeah, I’m gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
First thing, we’re gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
[grabs Jim’s leg] No, no. No, no, no! Don’t! Damn it, Tuna!
So I think you know what we want to know.
Jim, I’ve had enough of your unhelpfulness.
I really wish I could help. I’m not really sure how I can…
For God’s sake, did Robert tell you that he didn’t want me working here?
That’s the thing. See, I didn’t want to get in the middle of this. Still don’t. But here’s something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
[laughs] I think we’ve got ourselves an answer.
That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.
[Robert holds the door, she walks through] Thank you. [leaves]
Hey. Uh, I’m sorry about the position you were put in today.
You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.
Yeah, I thought we really hit it off.
You’re nothing! You’re so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?
This doesn’t help me. I don’t respond to that kind of strategy.
Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
All right, I’ll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?
Val Kilmer? I don’t buy it. That doesn’t make any sense. Wow… I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
They say that if you can strengthen your core, it improves your sexual performance. So, you will find me on the Ab-Blaster. And then you will find me blasting…uh, a very nice young woman.
Gotta get in shape. I’m doing Ironman next month. And I want him to be attracted to me.
Steve Martin. [laughs, then falls] uh, I’m fine. [grunts]
What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.
You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!
Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I’ve already covered the BM of it all. It’s miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.
So, Roberto Californio doesn’t want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this that’s impossible.
This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I’m not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley’s tie is really the story of the day…
You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I’ll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]
[on phone] Bob? Jim just went into the closet.
Ugh! He’s always one step ahead of us! How does he do that?
This whole accusation is insulting. Come on.
We know exactly what holiday you’re referring to.
It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.
I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. …Might not have been the best idea.
Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.
What about my wish that we don’t have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.
As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent….beachfront.
So, who’s wish is next? Oh, what about Santa’s wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica….C’mon guys, Jessica?…Jim, tell ’em who Jessica is.
Ugh! Gam-gam’s name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?
Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that’s not serious, by the way? Our repartee.
That’s great. When you know you know. Hey, what’s Ruth’s deal, man?
Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don’t go near Gam-gam.
I love Jessica, and I haven’t even met her yet. It’s like we don’t even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
It’s really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
That’s OK, I don’t want you to do that.
[laughing] Hello, ah. Merry Christmas, Erin. Kelly, Happy Pancha Ganapati.
The five day Hindu celebration in December honoring the god Ganesh, Patron of the Arts.
Hey! [Kevin embraces Robert in a tight hug] Oh!
How ya holdin’ up…because of your wife leaving you?
I actually appreciate the human intimacy. Feel like a kitten being cradled by a gorilla.
It’s been ten days since I had sexual intercourse.
Well you came to the right place….Ah, this, this party’ll cheer you right up.
Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
Sh sh sh sh! Don’t look. Who it was is not important…but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]
Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
Alright. I’m gonna speak in a language you both understand….Mo-nay.
Money….You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person.
You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.
Hi. I’m Jessica. I’m looking for Andy?
Jessica. Yes. We don’t say hi, we hug. [gets up and hugs Jessica] I’m Erin.
Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
My ex is meeting my sex….which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis…that’s just part of it.
Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you’re not talking about my penis. [laughs and kisses Jessica on the cheek] Hi.
Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr.
Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.
Oh, that’s great. Backbone of the office.
Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did. [Jessica laughs, Erin exaggerates back curve]
Ut oh, it’s kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis.
This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.
Oh yeah, and um there’s a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
Yeah, upstairs people? Cause you got a stick up your butt?
Ah! See, I, I, I thought it was because they’re so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time. [laughs] I, in my, I…
Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it’s fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
You had me at “clookies.” I can’t wait to find out what they are.
Oh, it’s nice, it’s real nice. People get dressed up.
I will look so handsome for you, Darryl.
Ah…[sees Dwight’s wallet and open email] I’m gonna s- [see’s Dwight watching from break room]
Dwight really wants my bonus. He’s trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can’t drink at this thing….I get really pranky when I drink.
Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
Now why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these shots!
The fifth one is for you, Erin. You could take it or leave it. To take it would be to accept that you’re at a party and you’re an adult woman, with an adventurous spirit. To leave it would be fine too.
[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card…you want the number? Oh it’s uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife…from me.
But look, it’s Christmas, so you’re allowed…[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you’re allowed to do…
I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
Since when does a sweater mean “dressed up”? Am I your grandson?
Come on, stay, alright? It’s good for people to get to know you.
As a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, maybe.
[imitating Stanley] I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. [group laughs] and then I want my nap!
How many drinks have you had tonight? I can’t be driving everybody home.
Whoa! Maybe you should take a break.
[serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding!
Ah! I’ve been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.
Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he’s also the world’s leading Egyptologist.
Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.
Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.
Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand…
Do you think that’s what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
OK, you know what? Why don’t we just call animal control…
Might wanna run that by Angela cause it’s so cute.
No. Porcupines don’t have souls. They’re like dogs.
[on phone] Yes, I’m calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
[on phone]Uh, I don’t know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?
What? …Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.
Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I’m so happy you guys are together. OK? [Andy and Jessica laugh] And you both have such beautiful hair.
I hope you guys get married….and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.
And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. [blows kisses and pushes Andy and Jessica’s faces together.] Ah! [laughs] OK, well I’m gonna go do another reverse spit. That’s how the cool kids say “get a drink”. [blows kisses and dances away]
That’s uh, that’s the girl you dated.
Um, yeah, she’s not always like that. It’s um…
Yep. [leaves Jessica to talk to Erin] Hey!
Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?
OK…maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.
I don’t wanna put you out, but if someone’s making oatmeal, I’ll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.
That’s not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.
[slurring slightly] It’s that I wish Jessica was dead.
You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn’t here or something.
I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground…with worms coming out of her mouth.
Hey, you know, you can’t say that, OK? That’s my girlfriend that you’re talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.
Too late! It’s already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar? [Andy leaves]
You know, don’t listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.
I was too embarrassed! [group laughs]
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
Oh my god. How could somebody do that?
I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.
Right. You’re right. So maybe it was me who did it…by accident.
I’ll figure it out, get to the bottom of it….Merry merry.
You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it’s like, hey, can they stay friends?
Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?
Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
By the way, I’m not gonna mess with you and Dwight’s bonuses. I think it’s causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.
You know what? You’re sitting, and thinking, and it’s probably better if it comes from me anyway.
You can’t click on these Kardashian links, that’s why you have so many viruses.
[group laughing] I don’t know what I was thinking, it was awful…
Jessica, did you just fart? [group stops laughing]
Let’s you and I take a walk. Oscar, you’re in charge of the bar.
What? I haven’t bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
And you have any advice or anything?
I’ve been married thrice and each has ended in an acrimonious divorce, I’m not sure I’m the best person to give love advice….I was hoping you were gonna make me feel better.
How long you, does it take usually? Cause…
…..Chad Flendermen’s kryptonite. [Darryl walks up to Toby and Val in a tuxedo]
Whoa. We got a real Clarence Thomas here.
Bye [kiss]…I still don’t get why you can’t just call her a cab and pay for it.
I would, it just, that wasn’t the holiday wish.
Either he drives or I drive. Now I’m drunk and mad.
OK, bye. [helps Meredith off the floor] Alright Meredith,
I know, I’m coming, I’m coming, I’m coming, I’m coming, I’m coming.
Alright. [Andy opens back of her van, things fall out]
This is my treasures, no they’re my treasures!
No I’m not, I’m gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful.
[laughs while spray painting “Jim is Awesome” on his own car, talks to porcupine in carrier] What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?
Ah, this is the posh part of town, huh?
Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?
Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now.
Erin, it was great fun tonight. Take a few aspirin and a whole lot of water, sleep in in the morning.
What are you smiling for? You thinkin’ what I’m thinkin’?
I’m sure I am not. Let’s get you home.
[yawns, “Idiot” is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How’s it goin?
Took a little nap right next to Jim’s desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What’s everyone staring at?
Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something……C’mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin’.
Oh, uh. Well, we thought we wouldn’t put the alcohol out till 11AM. It’s just…common…decency.
Par for the course. Par for the…freaking course. I’ll be in the party room having a cookie until 11. Haha! Yule-log.
Not destroyed. No….. Not destructive. Quite…off-kilter, sure. But… that’s too vague. [long pause] Erratic. Darkly erratic. [laughs awkwardly] That’s my mood.
How about I fix you some warm milk with some bourbon?
Maybe watch a movie…under a blanket…
Lovely. Wait, where is this taking place?
What…is happening to me? [pause] The lines in your haggard face are paths that lead nowhere. Your hair is the fire of hell. [hugs Meredith] I sincerely hope you find a sexual partner tonight.
It’s come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
Don’t look. Who it was is not important…but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
It’s so much closer to the bathroom, right?
Sorry it didn’t work out. Hope you find what you’re looking for.
[talking loudly] Sorry guys, Jim! This package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?
That’d be great, thank you. [Erin throws package, it hits Kathy. She thinks it was Jim who threw it]
So, I got this bucket from Jim’s garage and I filled it with everything disgusting. Except excrement. I can’t wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face. [laughs, then camera shows bucket being dumped on Kathy] Dammit Kathy!
For the past month, I have been collecting wishes from everyone in the office, and I intend to make good on every single one of them.
Now look, I may not have a great laugh like Santa, or a flying sled. But tell you what I do have. A Prius, a heart of freaking gold….
…and an American Express green card.
Ryan, for your holiday wish, you wanted ten sick days.
Yeah! Right? But with great perks come great responsibility, so I’m gonna be expecting a lot more from you…no more zoning out in your office.
Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
You really have to say “oh yeah” every time you eat a candy bar?
I can’t help it, Oscar. It’s just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah!
All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let’s try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!
You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it’s going to drive me insane.
[shows bloody hand] Does anyone have a first aid kit?
Check out this song I wrote: I’ma love you downstairs tonight… [overlapping chatter]
All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
[writing on board] Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?
Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
[gasps] Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? [scattered applause]
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don’t know what paper is.
I’m talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let’s get high on our own supply!
Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
Dwight Schrute for Robert California!
Oh, hello Mr. Schrute. I’ll tell him you’re here. Can I get you anything at all?
I’m not here to be given anything. I’m here to take what is mine.
Ooh. I’m glad you’re on our team. Here, please have a seat.
Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel’s office.
Impressive initiative. I don’t know what’s worse, the trip or the destination. [Gabe laughs] Well, uh, let me settle in and I’ll be with you shortly.
Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they’re willing to “play ball.” Those were his words.
Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
Well, it’s just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it’s a little more complicated than that.
It’s just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say?
I’m leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
It’s only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There’s a thousand dollar prize. I’m committed to my friends, they’re committed to me.
There’s a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.
But here’s the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase…
I’m so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, “this sounds really stupid.”
You just made a good idea, a great idea.
There is one problem with this plan.
We’d have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.
[on the phone] You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we’re going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. [hangs up]
Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You’re the bagel guy.
Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question: What’s the most important appliance in your house?
[makes buzzer sound] Too slow. It’s the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.
You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You’re an American classic.
Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I’m afraid. I’m not going to be able to meet with you, but I’m leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO.
But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
No, he’s going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I don’t want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. He’s a great person to know. I’ll dialogue with him tonight. [leaves]
CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.
Still an important position. Still a chief.
You’re really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. [Dwight sighs, Gabe’s phone rings] Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking.
Gabe, listen to me. Don’t bother Bill with this. He has to go put out a fire on the home front. Just wait twenty minutes and then I want you to listen to Dwight’s pitch. Make him feel valued. Make him feel heard.
I don’t believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.
I’ve got a quota to hit. I don’t care how I hit it.
And you guys thought this was a good idea?
There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That’s the thing about long drives, you know, you’re always going to- this is a gay bar.
Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?
Yes! It’s a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you’re going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar’s trivia night? [laughs]
It says that I believe that my staff’s intelligence and that I’m willing to try anything. [Oscar’s friend walks up] Not anything.
Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it’s winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.
Backups. [Jim goes to join the backups]
Go on, kid. You know you don’t belong here.
All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except… [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team]
All right, first question everyone: Ray Charles famously had this state on his mind. What is its capital?
Let’s reverse engineer this. You’re a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you’re a novelty. Alaska?
Oh I know you think that, because that’s where the Olympics were held.
My cousins were actually at those Olympics.
How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?
Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
Okay, time’s up. Let’s get the boards up. “Atlanta, Georgia” is the correct answer. [Kevin holds up “What is…SEE-attle”]
Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-
[sniffs] There’s no fires within eight miles of here.
Well, it’s nine miles away. I’m going to be meeting with you on his behalf.
What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO’s office on the phone this instant!
Okay, now, you’re not an all-star of the NBA, but you did get your game on when you won the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year award in 2011. Who are you?
That doesn’t sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor’s sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?
That’s it. I’m going to go watch the boats on the river.
No, it’s Lamar Odom. If it’d been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he’s at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.
All right, boards up. Let’s see who got it. “Lamar Odom” is what we were looking for. “Lamar Odom” Thank you. [scattered cheers]
You’re my sports guys! You’re ESPN, you’re ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I’m E!, TLC and Oxygen.
So it’s a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!
Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
You’re doing great. You know, so good.
And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! [Gabe makes a flushing motion, Dwight twists Gabe’s arm] Ow!
Uh, it’s a condo and it’s long-term business housing.
You know where it is. Lead me there.
Listen, you’re a perfectly fine toilet. I’m just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let’s go.
Excuse me, sir, on the Dunder-Mifflin A-team? Excuse me, sir?
I’m sure you’re just checking your Grindr account… [laughter] but you can’t check smart phones during trivia, it’s against the rules.
Okay, then we’re going to have to take it away. [employee takes the phone] Thank you.
Look, I can’t, I can’t not have my phone. I’m sorry. I want to be with my phone. [leaves]
D.M. Backup Team has three points. The Einsteins have eight points. [the “just-for-fun” Dunder-Mifflin team cheers] Ladies Gaga have five points. [more cheering]
So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.
I don’t know. All I know is the building.
Dwight! How nice of Gabe to show you where I live. Come around. 102.
In second place, we have the Queerenstein Bears.
And, in first place, is Aesop’s Foibles.
Ring it in when you know it. First question: This man had a fatwa declared on him when- [Erin rings bell] Einsteins?
I did my part, babe. I’m just the bell girl. [Oscar rings bell]
Salman Rushdie is correct. [applause] Heading out to sea, sailors. On a square-rigged ship, the sale set furthest forward is called what? [Erin rings bell]
Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-
Flying jib is correct for the Einsteins. [cheers and applause]
Guys, please help yourself to some drinks from the fridge.
According to a recent survey, this is the most common learning disability among American adolescents.
That’s correct for the Einsteins. [cheers and applause]
Dial it back, this isn’t Tail Feathers, okay? [laughter]
They haven’t really improved on the Oreo, have they?
Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, “table for one?” How is this possible?
You were dining alone? All those people are you?
Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going-
[holds a medal to the light] This medal was my grandfather’s. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It’s a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better? [holds out medal]
It’s a job interview, not a flea market.
Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I’ll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place.
Final round. Last two teams squaring off. I hope you’re ready to play doctor. Our question is about health and the human body.
The standard American analog scale has a maximum capacity of what weight? [bell rings]
Point for the Einsteins. [applause] Here’s your final question. Cinephiles, put on your memory berets: This 2001 masterpiece from Gilles Paquet-Brenner explores the intricate dynamics of a family in disarray.
[rings bell, answers in French] Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
I’m sorry, no. Over to the Einsteins.
Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
Look, I know it’s easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here’s a piece of trivia: a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
Welcome to the Stonewall Alliance Trivia Championships! First prize is forty-five hundred dollars!
Let’s just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
Michigan. [Kevin holds up “A Mitten”] The President of the United States is “P.O.T.U.S.” [Kevin holds up “P.O.T.A.T.O.”] John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath. [Kevin holds up “The California Raisins”]
You know what I thought would be fun? Is we do like uh, a switch-em-up maybe? Since only one of us needs to win, maybe I can get Kevin and Kelly and put together an all-star team?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.
Andy, we’re fine. We don’t wanna switch. We’re already like, the perfect unit.
Alright. Well just stay focused, try to concentrate.
When I dropped out of school to watch more sports, a lot of people thought that I was nuts. Well who’s laughing now?
Say “Shalom” to your shrubs on this Jewish holiday that celebrates the new year for trees.
Hey, is it true that you’re not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Ryan lies to me and says he has a whole Jewish holiday for an entire month…..
It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.
Alright, if you’re not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? That would be amazing.
Andy, it’s the last day of the quarter. We’ve already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
Yeah, I’m sitting on twenty-five hundred in sales I can make at any time but those are my wait till the separation is legal sales.
We gotta figure this out. Think of the look on Robert’s face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.
No, that’s why…that’s why I said think of it.
Andy, we’re gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point…whatever percent is pretty good.
Have I mentioned that it’s also quite good for amateur animation? [flips crude animation of stick figures representing him and Robert] Took me two weeks.
Jim, come on! That’s so juvenile! What the- [opens drawer full of meatballs]
Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim.
[Dwight finds stapler in giant meatball] Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
[to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight’s car] What’s the haul?
That idiot’s been feeding us for a week.
We’ll never have to buy meatballs again.
[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that’s so great to hear.
I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
Jessica! I love you! That’s a message from my mom.
[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
You know, there’s a glare from over here… oh wow, that’s magnificent.
I’m sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?
I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
Oh yes. How hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. Very funny, Jim. I get it.
Um, I’m getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.
A beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home. I think I’m entitled to the occasional bad day.
Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.
Dude, what if, since you’re feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs]
Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow.  Let’s try this: everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. Let’s just call it a get-together. And let’s say no food.
Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.
Oh, I don’t know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn’t drive maybe ever.
It’s no problem. You live right near me.
Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.
He wanted to make sure California didn’t put it in you.
Wow. Andy’s such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks]
[sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm.
I’m feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half.
[to Cathy] Well, we’ll say its eight-two and it’ll be our secret.
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That’s beautiful, I’m going to email that to you.
Join us. You must see what you were laughing about.
[hides ring] Yeah, it’s pretty serious poolage.
[sees Andy’s hand in his pocket] What are you doing?
Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh]
Gross. I’m getting a drink. Do you want anything?
[runs to Andy] Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
It’s great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.
Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
Well, I can’t. I’m going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.
I guess Andy isn’t totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn’t survive, and I believe him.
Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
You know, you are just as dumb at night.
All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.
Okay. You don’t know what you’re doing.
Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?
I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there’s a person in them.
Where… [finds pants, looks for ring]
Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]
[laughs] About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers.
Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
Well, and you have a… yes, a- d- another chateau.
With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night’s been magical.
Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it.
[laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?
Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
I’m not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I’m mighty? Because I’m the manliest man in the office? I’ll do it. [he picks her up]
[to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.
Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?
I don’t know. It looks pretty great to me.
I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan.
[raises wine bottle] To the kitchen!
Toby, what’s compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I’m through the gateway now, though, right?
[to Val] You know, I don’t think I’ve ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.
You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.
I’ve been working out. But, the problem is, I’ve been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn’t burned off yet. Awkward stage.
[he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that’s so good. Ah…
Andy’s not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
What is the most romantic possible thing?
We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
Dwight, that’s just- that’s really perfect. Thank you.
Yes! [they high five and jump in the pool]
Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
Okay, yeah. Who’s going to be my partner? Where’s Jim?
I’m right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
[knocks Cathy off Kevin’s shoulders] Yes! Woo!
Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
I know. I could just bang you right now.
He’s not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey!
I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears.
When I put in the screening room, I bought three movies: Caligula, Last Tango in Paris, and Emmanuelle 2. Last two movies I actually watched in here Marley and Me and On Golden [bleep] Pond.
I mean, it’s clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just- if you have the cables.
Kelly, that’s a crazy ring you found.
Yeah, thanks. I’m really glad I found it.
I can’t believe you’re wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?
Shh. Of course I’m superstitious. What are you talking about?
The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?
Oh, I don’t think you’re being silly.
You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.
[snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can’t allow that. We have to destroy it.
[to Andy] Come on. Let’s chicken fight those two.
[comes up from under water] How was that?
Okay. Watch my toes. [does hand stand]
Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you’ve been drinking.
Cool. [to Kevin] Does Darryl not swim?
That’s racist! I don’t know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
[knocks Erin off Dwight’s shoulders] Yes!
[to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.
Dwight, we’ve got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
Yeah! Great! [others cheer and clap]
I’ve got this! [Dwight gasps] Charge! Go! Go! [Dwight sinks]
[muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-
Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It’s okay. Just rest. Just rest.
You’ve broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]
Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis’s birthday.
Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis’s birthday.
I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn’t she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don’t want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.
So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.
Last I checked, I’m with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It’s monogamy for my hog ‘n me.
So then you won’t mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.
Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.
Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles]
Cannonball! [jumps in pool] Let’s do this!
So I kind of stepped on this. I think it’s yours.
Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?
Sorry if your special night was ruined.
Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it’s not a special night.
Honestly Erin, I don’t know what I’m doing. I… I just… I don’t know. Thank you.
Andy’s confused. That’s not what I was hoping for, but it’s not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.
Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
Oh, I’m sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.
Robert, I want you to know, I’m here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
And that goes double for me. I’ll stay even later than you’d like.
[Toby pours wine into Oscar’s mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
Gentlemen, bear witness. While I’ve been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. This is no get-together. This is a party. [Robert strips, jumps in pool, Gabe and Ryan join him]
Yes, that’s it. Push yourselves, boys. It’s not a party if you don’t do something that scares you. I need a breather. Oh. Oh. You two keep going.
Hey, he’s asleep. We can just leave.
Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?
Robert’s house is, well….I don’t mean to sound offensive, but it’s like where a basketball player would live.
Dwight gives the best back massages.
Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
I don’t know, why don’t you check me Dr. Shrute. [laughing]
No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It’s like the devil’s cursive.
You mean more like dangerous curves…
You’d be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out…[pushes Erin back to floor]
[Erin helps Dwight stretch his inner thighs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.
Let’s go before I vomit. [Erin and Dwight enter pool]
Get her! Ruin her! [Andy and Jessica beat Dwight and Erin]
My brother and I were the chicken fight champions of our swim club growing up. I mean, we beat the Strauss twins. Ok, I guess somebody didn’t grow up in west Hartford, Connecticut.
This room I liked for the view. I dreamed that I would watch my guests walk to their cars at dawn, their faces flushed with the shame and regret for the choices they made the night before. [laughs]
[Robert laughs] I live in this room.
[Toby and Oscar swig from wine bottles] Oh, Mineral-ey.
Promise me you’re going to clean up.
I can’t promise what I’m going to do or not do.
Oh, look at this. [hugs Jim] Tuna wrap.
Can’t believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
Ooh, “the case of the hit and run,” that’s exciting.
Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] “Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm.”
We’re best friends, actually. We’re going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
Is it black? ‘Cause that would be hilarious.
Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn’t due for another month.
We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
Aw man, I would but I can’t miss any more work.
Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
Yeah, Oscar’s the dad, I’m Oscar’s dad and Angela’s my mom.
We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
I love maternity wards. It’s the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right.
Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?
Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles.
Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
I never considered that my week off would make everyone else’s job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto’s.
Oh man, Ernesto’s. That was our favorite restaurant too.
You mean food truck. Ernesto’s was a food truck.
Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas.
[whispering] Guys, I don’t know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don’t know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It’s going to be really tiny, so please don’t say anything offensive.
Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door]
Oh… I don’t- I don’t want any- what are you guys doing here?
We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
Well, meet our not-so-little bundle of joy, Philip Halsted Lipton.
You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn’t prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
He’s more than substantial. He’s a monster.
So this whole hit and run thing, there’s just one part I can’t figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop…
And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
See, that’s what I’m having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert!
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn’t listening to you.
I am making a citizen’s arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight’s rights.
Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don’t know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.
I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.
I don’t- I don’t need to take a chill pill.
Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch.
I really don’t want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill]
Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let’s just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
Yeah, sure, of course. I’d fire him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously]
That’s good enough for me. [exhales again]
…and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn’t matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
I feel terrible getting lied to. No one’s ever lied to me before.
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?
Do you know why you never heard of it?
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
They used to call me King Tut because I’m so good at keeping things under wraps.
My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.
[pulls food truck up to where Dwight and Nate are standing] Where you want I park?
Okay, everybody, gather ’round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]
Uh, I’m going to say “I” when I’m talking for Ernesto, so instead of “he says blah, blah, blah,” I’m going to say “I say, blah, blah, blah,” but that’s for him. Anyway, it was something like, “He remembers Toby.” [makes face] “I remember Toby.”
Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?
No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn’t asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish]
Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.
Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]
Ah, he doesn’t want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets.
Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
Usually I’m a burrito guy, but if you won’t tell, I won’t. Wink, wink.
Great. And while we’re enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don’t you tell us your story again?
Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole ‘Murder, She Wrote’ thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.
His car broke down. So he called me, ’cause I live near the courthouse.
Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim’s house, and then back to the courthouse?
Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.
[to Ernesto] I’m sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
We’re getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?
Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
I’m not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can’t keep spinning gold out of your [bleep].
Okay, listen, all right? Dwight’s on to us, he’s going to figure it out really soon, so let’s just get ahead of it, let’s tell the truth.
[sighs] I don’t even know what the truth is anymore.
Because I squat with five pounds. This- [squats, grunts] yeah, this feels like more than that.
No, no, no, he’s nine pounds, seven ounces.
Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?
Oh yeah, I don’t know if it’s right, but-
Well, if it’s anything like that gorgeous wrapping paper, you hit it out of the park.
Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.
This baby is clearly not premature. They’re lying about the date it was conceived. It’s very interesting. And her husband’s gay. I don’t even know which thread to follow.
[laughs] You’re screwed! Oh, it’s happening. It’s really happening.
What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.
Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn’t, then I hope I die.
Dwight, cut it out. I’m not firing Jim.
No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-
I know what I said. Jim, you’re in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I’m going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap]
That’s it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim’s desk and leaves]
[on voicemail] You’ve reached Gabe Lewis, I’m currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao. [beep]
Gabe, it’s Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
I’m gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.
Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
It’s fine. Pajamas aren’t supposed to be baggy, right? It’s not the barrio.
The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.
The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.
And now you all know, but you can never tell. I’m serious.
He went to the car or something, but he’ll be back.
Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
Angela got pregnant before the wedding.
She got pregnant before the wedding.
A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn’t hear it from me!
Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It’s not worth it.
Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions… [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.
That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.
No, you don’t have to. I’m going to wear this cover.
Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
Hi. Wow, I really thought I’d be more excited to be here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it’s great to see you!
Whoa, no, no. That’s overdoing it, I think.
Wow, what a surprise. That’s crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.
Aw! You guys. He’s licking on my finger, just like my cat does.
Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
[gasps] Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.
No, but that would’ve been a really good idea.
Oh my goodness, let’s take a look at these. They’re usually amazing, so let’s see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?
She says “no” to everything. You know, she thinks my name is “No.” Cece, do you want some broccoli?
Why am I shorter than the table that I’m standing next to?
There’s cross-hatching in some of these. That’s kind of advanced for a two-year-old.
Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?
So then this means nothing to you. [rips picture]
Hey, Cece, why don’t you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?
You know what? I don’t think you need to do things on command. That’s very weird. I’ll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
I don’t know what else we can do here.
It’s okay, honey. [Philip cries] It’s okay, it’s okay.
All right, I know, I know. Let’s just get this.
Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.
Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.
You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
-and I said, “I bet I could fulfill you,” and you said, “I’d like to see you try,” and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
And even if it did, it’s just a coincidence.
Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head.
Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.
I don’t know what that means. We’re gonna circumcise him.
[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
I’m looking, I’m looking for the pacifier.
Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we’re going home, we’re going home. We’re going home, we’re going home. I know, I know, bud.
Hi, all right. I’m just going to go down to the car and I’m going to put her in her seat and I’ll be right back up.
No, no, it’s okay, I’ll be right back.
I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.
Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let’s go.
Dwight, what the hell? You can’t smoke in here.
Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.
You had something important to tell me?
Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they’re raising us. Am I right?
I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that’s not happening, I’m not averse to just buying them all off.
Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it’s always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it’s like red city in there. So, enjoy it.
So you effectively spent what…four dollars on the entire office?
Uh, I can’t get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can’t…
You’re nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-
[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you’re just gonna throw away perfectly good food?
I know what you can do Jim. Take those black licorice, then go get some of those red licorice, take ’em in your hand, roll ’em up real tight…
Dammit Jim! You stole my afternoons, now you stole my line! It’s not “shove it up your butt” it’s….I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you dead!
EAT IT! [Jim begins eating black licorice]
No, it’s bad. Darryl canceled go-karting….
When were you going go-karting with Darryl?
Alright. Just don’t worry, we’ll figure this out.
I feel like a stranger in my own country.
Ok. Well, hey, you’re not here. You don’t know, Ok? It’s intense. They made me eat black licorice.
Everyone, this is Officer Foley from the Scranton PD. Works down at the courthouse. I think he has something he’s like to say.
I understand that some of you don’t believe that Mr. Bernard drove his friend into the courthouse for jury duty last week.
Weren’t you in Sweeny Todd last year with Andy?
You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?
That is so offensive and ridiculous. I-
So if I started singing “Down By the Old Mill Stream”, you couldn’t join me in a three part harmony. [Andy and Officer Foley shake their heads no, Darryl begins singing] Down by the, down by the, down by the….
[singing] Old mill stream. When I first met you, down by the old mill stream [Andy & Foley hold “stream”]
Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she’s no longer pregnant. [pretends to punch Pam in the stomach] Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.
You still had eight weeks more than we did.
[laughing] Well, it’s not exactly a vacation.
Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!
What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin…family baby. Four days ago.
I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I’ve got brownies and magic cookie bars.
[murmurs of delight as people shuffle toward the treats]
Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin’s allergic to walnuts. You’re allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?
Extremely, but I’m gonna fight through it.
Aw. It’s OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
I don’t know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
When did you find time to do all this?
Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It’s really good.
I wouldn’t know, I’m watching my weight. Ugh.
So you guys, you know what’s an even more useful treat…is cash. So-
Dwight, I have exciting news for you.
Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email… from corporate….that told me that…
That…[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that’s not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.
If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.
No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
And here’s some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.
Yeah, it’s weird that I said that last one.
So… [points out their matching heart pins]
Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.
Yeah. That’s cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. [Andy laughs, walks away, Erin throws away her pin]
For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy’s still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don’t know, I wouldn’t mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn’t want to spend that much time with Jessica.
Val knit me a beanie. But I can’t if it’s a “we’re just friends” beanie or a “I’m hot, you’re hot, let’s get it poppin’” beanie. So I’m gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we’ll get to the meaning of the beanie.
Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I’m going to be living for the next three weeks.
I’ll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.
Eh! No plus one’s. This is for competent workers only. And don’t worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.
Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?
[clears throat] Notice anything different about me?
You’re wearing the beanie. You like it?
Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.
I love it too Val. It’s it’s really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can’t really peg it on the hat.
[noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It’s like the nation of Islam down here.
I like to knit, don’t hate. And who’s that for?
Oh, this is a gift, for….my man Nate here.
Ah, I can’t wait. I’m sorry. I get too excited. [opens gift] Darryl.
Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
[reading card] “I’m glad you’re in my life. Happy Valentine’s Day.” Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.
I just got a text from Robert California that says “bring your clubs to Florida”.
Why? Does he think you’re going to Florida?
I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?
No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it’s like wha-what?? Just do one.
You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?
Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?
They’re not expendable exactly, I just can’t…I can’t think of the word I’m trying to find.
Are you kidding me?! I’m supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We’d never get off the runway.
Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here’s your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you’re also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.
Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
“Got your text, awesome idea. Let’s hit the links next time you’re in PA” Dash JH.
It’s perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.
Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
Oh, sorry I asked for the main shipping number. I just need the address for the warehouse? I want to send my girlfriend some flowers.
Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?
Cool. Um, so can I get that address or…?
Yeah sorry, I’m just looking for a pen.
May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
Oh, no big deal. It’s just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.
Oh, I’m sorry Stanley, I can’t share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.
Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back.
It just feels like a slap in the face.
I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I’m sure he had his reasons.
We’re not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman’s gotta take off his cape.
Good point. But we’re gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it’s gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.
It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there’s an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy’s office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.
Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren’t picked and maybe you could just clarify?
Well uh…well the deliberations were confidential so…I feel like we should respect that.
Respect it? You’re trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.
Ok, it’s obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!
I use the word “guys” a lot when I’m nervous…guys.
Dudes…the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.
OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
If anybody’s going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn’t a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I’m the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.
OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I’m happy to hear you out.
Great idea! So why doesn’t everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.
No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.
Come up with a statement in the next hour….
[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
Good. Doesn’t sound pushy…you’re just stating a fact.
Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
Really did [Text bleep] He responded L-O-L.
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in….
I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What’s that? It’s not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that’s all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That’s myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That’s what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team…or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.
Because I feel like that I’m in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there’s like a crazy mismatch or something…
Ok. Thank you Kevin, we’ll let you know.
Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.
It is real, thank you for saying that.
Yeah, wow. It’s almost like we’re not all experiencing the same winter?
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
You know I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.
Well it wouldn’t be hard to find someone to fill in..
Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good.
Now, is it too dark to say that Cici’s having an operation?
It’s only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it’ll be..
I was going to say good because I’ll have all the help I need?
Yeah, that’s what I’m saying. They’re incredibly helpful, you’re lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won’t even know I’m gone.
Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?
Tuns, I’m really sorry. You’re too essential to the operation here, I can’t let you go.
I wouldn’t say that…it’s a bit much.
You know Dwight, if you didn’t want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn’t go.
Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]
Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that’s gonna make us roomates.
Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you’re showering. Save some water.
OK, listen up everyone, here’s who’s going to Florida: Kathy..
You’ve gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
Let’s go, step it up you runts. You infants, let’s move.
But? There’s not buts. That’s it. You’ll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer]
SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON’T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I’m done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits]
[Sighs and grunts] Orientation is over.
Yeah, you know I, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn’t get you anything…
No, it’s anything but cool. Now I haven’t really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes. [Hands Darryl pink slips of paper]
“This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack”
Yeah, they’re Nate coupons. Or Nate-pons. And they’re all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. I’ll find you.
Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom’s name is Brandon?
[laughs] Yeah Darryl, my mom’s name is Brandon.
Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
I’m going to Florida…..and I’m not coming back.
So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we’re at corporate.
Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don’t have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don’t write it down unless you like it.
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?
No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
[long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
I don’t know how I’m going to live here without you.
Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I’m not going to need it down there.
Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.
No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
[On phone] All expenses paid. Yeah, Jim’s gonna be there. Their marriage is not good. Nobody knows better than me. Definitely we will. It’s three weeks in Tallahassee, what else is there to do?
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! [Erin kicks him] Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?
Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
Stanley! Wake up! You’ve got to wake up, the hotel’s on fire!
Stanley, wake up, it’s pretzel day! [Dwight pinches Stanley’s nose and covers his mouth]
Hey, wake up. Let’s have some fun. We’re in Florida now.
Hey, you. I’m so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water’s fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!
I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I’m up and at ’em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn’t know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]
Heeeere’s Dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] Oh man.
Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees “IT WAS DWIGHT” written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn’t me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream]
Yeah. It’s weird being away from them. Never done this before.
Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
I’ll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn’t acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.
Okay, and this one is, “Huh. Don’t see too many museums around here.”
Okay, Twiggy, that’s enough. Get in the car.
I’m fine, okay? It’s just stress. You know, ’cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.
Are you sure it’s stress? Because I did poison you.
Oh no, I’m serious. I was thinking, “For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?” and then I thought of it. I’ll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
That’s a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
Laugh it up, Halpert. I’m in Florida for a month without my family. I’m gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.
You’re a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.
Did I say “Messina?” [tires screech]
Ahh! [laughs] Sorry I couldn’t resist. It’s so quiet.
I like it. It’s so peaceful, I’ve already written like, twelve plays today.
It’s so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin… [drops pin] I thought that would be cooler.
Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.
Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it.
Can we see that? Did you really find it?
Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. [chuckles, clicks tongue] In the trash.
Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn’t the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.
I know, but I can’t cover reception. I have a ton of work to do.
Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it’s for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. [ringing continues] Hello, you’ve reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?
Life is short. “Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse.” That’s one of my mottoes.
I would love to hear the other mottos.
Yeah, Dwight and Jim tried to get me fired, but I landed on my feet down here in Florida. You see, this cat’s got nine lives, and a nine-inch-
Psst. Say, “So who’s leading this thing, anyway?”
So who’s leading this thing, anyway?
Psst. Say, “I can’t wait to meet him.”
Him, you say? Don’t think a woman can be a leader?
Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one.
No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic.
Well that was just one idea. It doesn’t have to be winter.
Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it.
Let me just get the projector working.
You got to stop with the antacids. It’s not the antidote.
You didn’t poison me, it’s just stress.
Jim, help me lower this screen. You’re a big, tall man. [points to Ryan] You’d be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon.
I’ll do it! I always say, “You want something done right? Ask Dwight.” Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you’ll never be able to get that out of your head. [reaches up, whimpers]
Mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] There we go.
Dwight, I didn’t poison you. I was kidding.
Yeah, I’m gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There’s no name listed.
Is there not? Maybe I’m just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks]
Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance?
Send it to the frickin’ moon, idiot.
I tell you what though, since my move down to Florida I’ve really gotten back into hunting big time.
Totally. I mean, I’d never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting’s intense.
You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I’m a master hunter.
I’m a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that’s a master baiter.
Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let’s get back to work! Break’s over!
It’s just rum. I’m not bored, I’m a pirate.
It’s whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle]
Or do you only drink with your kids?
Ah, let’s do it. [laughs] Oh, that’s healthy.
I’ve spent so much of my life telling myself “Please, don’t end up like Stanley,” and now I’m wondering if I even have what it takes.
We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We’ve got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans… pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It’s a team-building exercise. You’ll love it. Who’s in? Hmm?
All right, what the heck? Let’s do it.
This is great. This is gonna be great.
I’ll be on top. It’s the most important position.
Dude, I think you have appendicitis.
Dwight, why don’t we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I’m gonna vomit!
Dude, don’t you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen.
Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida’s pretty loose with the death penalty.
You need an operation. You have appendicitis.
Don’t remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
That was an interesting diversion. Shall we get back to the meeting?
Yeah, I figured we’d keep things savory while Oscar’s mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.
Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys, look at me, I’m huge.
Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. [whispers to Kelly] I put out some new magazines, check it out.
I’m acting like I like reception and I’m a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. [phone rings] Oh, there’s the phone!
I just got out of surgery. What’s going on? Fill me in.
Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
Packer’s giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim’ll probably give ours, I guess.
-features a tech support area. Bring in your product, a bunch of nerdy virgins fix it on the spot. Huge for building loyalty.
Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.
Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
No, I don’t feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.
[doing jumping jacks] Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-
You haven’t done any of the research.
“You’re too slow, you’re too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name.” You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I’m going to do it.
Stanley, are you listening to music?
All right, who’s ready for the next presentation?
What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.
Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
Mail call! [sings] His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail ’cause it’s your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen… yogurt.
Anderson’s three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
What are the three pillars of retail?
Very true. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant’s brother, John Grant. He’s older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.
Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
You are bleeding through your shirt.
Oops. That’s embarrassing. Egg on my face. [ties jacket around wound] Ah.
Well I know how it is. I know it’s a lot of fun. I don’t know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?
[groans] Ugh! Fine. Did you see this? [points to pens in cup]
Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
Oh! That’s disgusting. That’s barely healed.
You’re not paying me to heal, you’re paying me to kick ass.
A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.
That is amazing. Todd, look at that.
Oh, yikes. Incoming- [tries to touch the wound]
Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you [points to both] have a lot to offer.
I’ll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.
[answers the reception phone] Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew.
Oh, she’s on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks.
Oh, good for her. She’s such a sweetheart. You tell her Donna Muraski misses her.
Everyone, we have a very special guest. He turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. I give you Wally Amos, founder of Famous Amos Cookies. [cheers, claps]
Aloha, aloha, aloha. So I hear you’re all looking to bake up some dough in the sales game. Well, back when I was regular Amos-
Cookies. Bet you anything it’s cookies.
It’s cookies. Let me- let me finish my speech first.
Ah, we get the gist. It’s just success and effort, isn’t it? So just, don’t be coy, make with the cookies! [everyone goes for the cookies]
Famous, hi. I’m sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-
Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
News flash – If you didn’t carry it around for nine months, it isn’t your kid.
Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course.
Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?
No, three-month-old humans don’t do that.
Exactly. That’s just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That’s two sleep schedules, two naps that don’t coincide, I mean, you’ll never sleep again.
Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
[laughing] Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There’s nothing harder than taking care of a boat…am i right?
It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That’s not bad, is it?
Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. [Dwight raises his hand] Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP.
I can’t be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more.
Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
That’s a hobby, unless it’s for food.
Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.
Alright, I’m gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just… you three, no.
English peoples’ main use today is judging American talent. [British accent] You’re crap. You’re wonderful. [back to American] They’re mean, but they’re incisive.
Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. I’m not allowed to say it’s mandatory, so let’s just call it compulsory.
Ugh, we’re gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren’t we? Maybe we’ll see the real ‘Talla-nasty’ we’ve been hearing so much about.
Wait, wait, you think she invented ‘Talla-nasty?’ [chuckles] no, no, no, no…
Cathy? It’s been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he’s turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? [Jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the ‘Jim Face’]. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
Okay, everybody. 5:00. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring ’em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins!
Yes, the conference room is set up. I’ve got pens, I’ve got paper, I’ve got a whiteboard, we are good to go!
Tonight we’re staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.
Yes, of course, we could’ve just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.
…ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government’s out to get him.
Genghis Khan could take ’em both down ’cause he’s not afraid to kill children … What? it’s true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips.
That’s a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
What happens if you’re the hunchback?
No, they’re not transferrable just ’cause I handed ’em to you.
Well, that’s how I played it in college.
College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
Aaaaand he host at his own lame game.
Ooh, double meaning! The game was lame, and now he’s lame from the kick. Quick wit.
I’ll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
I’m young, and I can … and if I can’t, I’m still pretty young. I guess I’ll always be young.
You come with me. We’re gonna get you that waffle.
Why would Erin confide in me that she’s staying here in Florida if she didn’t want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
Hey. I see what you’re doing. It’s futile. the VP position is mine.
Oh, please, You’re through. She’s going to give it to me as I’m giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle. [clicks tongue, whinnies]
Well, saddles… [clicks tongue, whinnies] … sometimes fall off, especially if you don’t properly cinch the girth.
What? That’s a joke, right? You see the way she’s all over me.
If anyone’s having sex with Nellie for personal gain, it’s me, and I’m not joking at all. If you don’t tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
If I wanted Jamaican food I’d just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf!
How you doing, Val? [Val and Brandon kiss]
Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
Darryl, I heard about you. You doing good?
Must be doing real good since you’re f***ing my girlfriend.
Dude, you didn’t tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
I’m not sleeping with your girlfriend.
Brandon, what the hell are you talking about?
Don’t play dumb with me. I know what’s up.
Heyyy… let’s get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!
[imitates seagull calls] Seagull. [Continues seagull calls]
And a wave crashing… a wave crashing.
Alright, that’s gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It’s like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here?
Uh… yeah, I’m just watching basketball.
Cool… [Jumps onto bed] Is this March Madness? I love March Madness.
Oh, no, that’s not this ’cause that’s in… March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so… [sits on floor]
Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it [puts string in his mouth]
I read the text you sent to Val, man.
No, baby girl. It would be messed up if I didn’t find anything, but I did, so-
I’m pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.
It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery…
Guys, we’re not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
I thin we’re gonna need to here those texts.
Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?
No. There’s no way in hell I’m leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
Yup, coming. [opens door] All right.
Do you want to watch the game with us? We’re watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
Stanley. Uhh… you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
Yeah, they keep them on ’cause it’s less expensive than turning them on and off.
I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl…
[whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
“I got too much ice cream. You want some?” “Getting’ my fry on.”
Ooh, gosh, the moon one’s damning. Yeah, sorry.
“You’re such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.”
Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, ’cause three dots means ‘to be continued’, four dots is a typo, but five dots means “Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
Brandon, Darryl and me? That’s ridiculous, right?
Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I’m stranded on shutter island over here.
You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] …ahhmmm… excuse me… What?! Not now, I’m busy.
[on phone] I’m sorry, I thought you’d want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no… Freak, I need a favor.
Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.
I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
You really want Packer as your boss?
If Jim has bedbugs, that means they’re everywhere. I can’t risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
We gotta find it before it eggs. [pulls sheets off bed]
Could be a bat weevil… Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
Check your hair! [checks Jim’s hair]
God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower.
Alright, then I will catch you later… What do we do now?
We wait. [Shower starts] Come to papa.
I don’t know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
Well, maybe it isn’t warm enough in here.
Oh, it’s plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
If there were any in here, They would’ve imbedded themselves in me.
No, you’re good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.
No, that’s the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
Is that really how you want to get this job?
Okay, Dwight… Dwight… Dwight, Dwight Dwight!… uh…
They don’t make these cords in boot cut anymore!
Euughh… Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present… Hey.
Yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster… Okay, cool. Thanks… I know, I’m a pig, right?
[giggles] Wait, this why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. Seriously.
Okay alright. [gets up] I’m really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I’m-I’m married. I’m very happily married.
I know that you’re married, I sat at your wife’s desk. How little do you think of me?
I’m sorry, I feel like maybe I’m-I’m I misread things. Okay, let’s just go back to watching.
Can you… without running to the other side of the room all night?
Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I’m really sorry. I think we’ll just… we’ll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don’t care.
Okay. [Sits next to Jim.] I am so cold.
Play it cool, man. She’ll come around.
No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would’ve happened with me and Jim if he didn’t put himself out there.
Yeah, but… My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool.
My husband would tell you to go for it.
I know. Can I give you a compliment? I’m really impressed by how much you’ve grown. Since I met you, it’s like night and day.
We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you’re a guy, I’m a girl-
[louder] Six months?… um, okay, I’m in love with Kelly.
Put your forehead near mine,  and see if you can read my thoughts.
Try again… Ugh, I’m still getting numbers! Seven, one, one… is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? ‘Cause please stop, okay?
Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]… Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie]
Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee…
I got Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion…
Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again?
Hey, just so you know, me and you… I don’t think that’s ridiculous… Dot, dot, dot… dot, dot.
All right. Now I think it’s time for you to go.
What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You’re cool, right?
[wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where’s the bug?
[sprays the bed and Cathy] Stand back!
Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?!
[continues spraying the bed] It’s a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid’s cart!
[coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
You can’t stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I’d just bunk with Cathy.
Second best Bananas Foster I’ve ever had.
[at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight?
‘cause I feel like I’m gonna fall off.
I’m not wearing the right shoes for this.
We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn’t even get a callback.
The black one. I never stood a chance.
Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.
Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.
When people see this presentation, they’re gonna [bleep] in their pants.
Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.
I don’t see what that gets us, but I’m a team player.
Schrute’s out to get me. But I’m playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator.
I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.
Speaking of pimples, let’s release the BLOGGERS!
Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
Listen, it’s important. You’ve gotta hear this.
I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
It’s not a kid on a bike. It’s a man in a car.
Hey, I was on the can. What’s this about a black guy in the office?
Will someone please explain what’s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it’s like my life is buffering.
Here’s what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam…
I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.
I didn’t do anything any of you wouldn’t have done.
Open the gates! There’s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There’s plenty for everyone!
There’s plenty. Don’t stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It’s gonna be fine. It’s gonna be fine. There’s plenty of Pyramids.
God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I’m trying to be a good girl for once.
Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don’t want to leave yet. I haven’t had so much fun since seeing… zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
No, no, no, no, no, we don’t need to call the police. They’ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone’s business, right, Pam?
Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.
Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.
Guys, guys. That’s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
Look, I don’t feel safe. I think we should call the police.
Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why… Toby is giving us self defense training.
Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?
Yeah, um… I can’t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I’ll go put on my cup.
I wasn’t really sure which one of you is Chuck.
[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
Look at that guy. He’s got his Sabre phone on, and he’s not even using it.
This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog.
Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.
Oh, no, no, no. It’s good. It’s really — on the Internet, it’s a really — that’s a really good, good, thing.
Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
I’m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck!  Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
[laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is — damn it. Take over.
Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So… strike, scream, and run. All right? Let’s try it.
[smacks Meredith’s head] [screams] [runs out]
Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you’re not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. “It’s all about the groin.”
What if you’re being attacked by a … smallish man who happens to not have a groin?
What if you’re being attacked by a 4’11” man who is penisless?
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
Why don’t we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.
Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.
So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?
It’s interesting that you’re drawn to the point of view of the attacker.  You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel… [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.
Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
All right, well, let’s try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn’t everyone stand? Okay, so… you’re being attacked. You’ve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.
Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.
But you still work for Wired, right?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think …it seemed like you were a little nervous.
Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
I’m trying to make him feel important.
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
Um… [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you’re so smart. You’re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.
You’re so ignorant. You barely know what you’re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
On my God. You’re so embarrassing.  My mom would say the best stuff, though.
[ahem] You can… [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.
And you know that I’m capable of this.
You’re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
What did you think of the presentation?
I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one —
Oh! “Fix” means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you’re alive.
Forgive me for interrupting. I believe my daughter had an altercation with somebody here, some fancy gentleman with a squeaky voice?
[deep voice] I think you guys might have the wrong Office.
Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
What about the lady you hit with the pine cone?
Sorry I kicked your ass in front of your “thin” girlfriend.
How ‘bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
You know what? Tiffy’s going to college.
[deep voice] Listen, I don’t know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I’ll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.
God bless. Friend of mine uses your paper. You do good work. Bye bye.
So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar — “How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.”
There’s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.
No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
Oh God…  Hey no! Where do you think you’re going? You’ve gotta stay for the big presentation we’ve got this young wiz kid — Ryan. He’s like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
[on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it’s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it’s different because it’s your wife?  Well, that doesn’t make any sense to me.
Don’t talk to me right now. I’m sorry. I- I know you’re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don’t understand is… [voice fades]
[to Dwight] Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.
Sorry about kicking you out. It’s just, we don’t want our brand associated with death.
It’s okay. I’ll go to the Costco and search for handsome men.
[laughs] Oh, I was. My husband was my best friend. He passed away.
My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we’re not really friends.
Someone rejected you? With that body and those bazongas? Forget him!
Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
How long has he been in the bathroom?
Jeez! What’s he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates]
Oops, that’s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
It’s Ryan. “I’m sorry. I lied. I’m not in the bathroom. I can’t do it. I need to see my mom. I’m going home.”
What is the delay here? Where’s Ryan? Why is he not here?
I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing… compared to this guy!
That’s right. Will you just give us a second?
You are gonna bloody ruin it. You’re gonna bloody ruin it because you’re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed…
Look at me. Look at me! Look… at… this… face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I’m telling you… if you don’t do this, [whispers] I don’t stand a chance. Please, Jim.
Oh, my God. O… Kay! Go get into Ryan’s costume and check out his notes.
Of course there’s a costume! [laughs]  Oh, this is gonna be great. There’s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
[image on Pyramid] Sabre… It’s time… to come home.
All right.  Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]
Okay, this isn’t over. Let’s stay focused, okay?  We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but… little things can be dangerous.
Whether it’s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
With all due respect we know what we’re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.
Yeah, that’s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
I don’t know if this is gonna help…Uh…
We should stay to maybe some more traditional models…
You think you’re so pretty!  Well you’re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
Okay, this is what’s called pre-violent posturing.
Take that!  Not so pre-violent anymore!
Okay, I’m at what’s called “the decision point.”
Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly… come on…. Ow! God! My good eye!
[laughs] Oh boy. Oh no, I’m not laughing at you. I’m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier — yesterday. This morning.
You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby.  I stepped in and I didn’t care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, “Where were you when the girls came?”
Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off.  I just feel good!
Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it.  We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.
Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!
He’s gone, damn it! He’s been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he’s staying in Florida forever.
Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.
Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.
If Dwight’s not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
You guys, we’ve gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the “treasure box” and slams it down on Dwight’s desk]
I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees]
Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody’s gonna open it. You’d have to be insane. [everyone turns to look at Creed]
[to Creed standing in front of the “treasure box”] Now, carefully… open the box.
[opens box, pulls out and displays contents] It’s a photo of all of us.
Aw, that’s so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling]
[on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it’s been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball]
Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP.
I am loving the chemistry between you two.
I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George.
Trick… there’s no such thing. It’s not even a real English duo.
I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn’t exist either.
[to Robert] You think you’re excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh]
Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]
[sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that’s so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah!
This is the last time I’ll ever see Dwight. It’s a weird feeling, it’s, um, what’s the word? It’s not, it’s not bittersweet. It’s uh… sweet. Yeah.
[entering Andy’s office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don’t care what it is, dealer’s choice.
[entering Andy’s office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha’s first year in the troops, so I’m selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?
I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
You can’t claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can’t you sell at your church or barber shop? [Darryl looks hurt] Or chess club, or?
You know what? It’s your first time, let’s split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don’t know I’ll just take, uh, accounting.
That’s it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl.
[exits Andy’s office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
[entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I’m home, babaloo.
[rises from chair] Oh, here let me help.
[spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
When can I introduce you to my grandson? He’s a wonderful swimmer. Shallow end, deep end. He does it all.
Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I’m staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]
[takes mug] Thank you. [takes a sip] Oh, what kind of tea is this?
[misses putt] Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We’ll just chalk it up to cultural bias.
If I may, [assists Nellie] try holding the putter… yeah, with your wrists here. And your thumbs here.
[approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies?
[Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It’s not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
[to Darryl] Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.
You’re new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
No, no, no. It’s not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?
That doesn’t mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
[looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don’t fight over me.
You know, why don’t we split the order? It’s only fair.
No. Wait, no. I’m buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and… 69ed.
Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts… no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]
Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.
[to Dwight] All right. So… I guess this is it.
Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven’t always got along and at times, I’ve even hated your guts. But…[smiles] bye, bye. I win.
[attempts to shake Dwight’s hand] Goodbye, Dwight.
[drops golf ball into Jim’s open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen’s bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]
I’ll let Dwight have his fun. Today will not be his day.
I’m gonna tank the Sabre store at the presentation to the board.
Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers.
Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
I couldn’t just kill the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight.
[from distanced golf cart] Robert! I’m gonna win, ha ha, I’m the gentleman! Suck it!
[to Dwight] Bravo, Dwight! Very good! [Jim looks surprised] [to Jim] Shame.
[at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two.
I’m not just saying this, that was the best thing I’ve ever seen.
When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how ’bout I pop up also? I guess we’d have to say ‘power of three’. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. [to Nellie] You’d spin off right. I’d spin off-
You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It’s gonna make some really good toilet paper.
[enters room] All right. There he is.
What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
What, your stylist ran out of ‘messy spray’? [others laugh]
Um, actually it’s, it’s for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]
You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop ’til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]
Nice. [To Jim] Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy?
[interrupts] I know what you’re trying to do, I don’t want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.
That’s… that’s the same guy. It’s the joke I made.
You know, I just think you should know that-
[interrupts] That you look like the world’s tallest hobbit. [others laugh]
Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it’s on the record. I have a plane to catch.
Can you help me? I’m trying to make a video chat with Andy.
Just open the program and type in his user name.
[after briefly typing] Here, type in your password.
That’s a terrible password. And you don’t ‘make a video chat’, you video chat.
That’s so weird. There’s something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it.
Oh, now mine’s broken. Hang on. [turns his laptop on its side while lying on desk] Oh, there we go.
[on phone with Jim] He said, ‘I did like Dwight’? He’s gonna fire him.
No, no, I think it was more like, ‘you know, I liked him, but I don’t anymore because he did a bad job, so I’m definitely gonna yell at him’.
Robert doesn’t talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
Yes… my pretty hardest. Look, you haven’t dealt with him in awhile, all right. He’s like super Dwight. It’s like he’s been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
Stanley’s very upset that we’re leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
If Dwight’s about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That’s all you can do.
[to Kevin] What’s a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can’t trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
That’s true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby’s probably in bed with some model.
I’m, I’m not gonna comment on my personal life.
Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?
Baby, if you’re watching this, you’re not chubby, you’re beautiful. Daddy’s just got to sell some cookies. And we’re also gonna exercise more. It’s gonna be fun.
[to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
Make them kiss me. [everyone ‘ew’s] [Toby and Darryl look at each other]
Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
I don’t buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I’m gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally ‘puerto ricania’ when i see you.
I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view]
No, it’s not worth it? That’s too bad. ‘Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
Oh yeah, I’m talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]
[straightens tie in mirror] Showtime.
You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You’re like an Amish return stick.
OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
And then, I’m pretty sure he’s gonna fire you for it.
Wait. [holds up fingers] He’s gonna kill the store? And he’s gonna fire me?
Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they’re not going to work today.
OK, first of all, they’ve mostly worked, so-
You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It’s gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
[Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help!
Gross! Don’t lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
[attempting to break from Jim’s grasp] Ah!
[clutching side] Oh, god! You… oh! My appendix-
[stops whining and charges Jim] Rrrah!
[to Cathy] Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.
Well, looks like Shnoot’s a no-show. Guess he wasn’t vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I’m your man.
[considers and decides on Packer] Right, let’s begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer.
[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin’s desk] What are you doing?
I’m just dealing with Erin’s stuff since apparently she’s not coming back. And she didn’t bother to tell anyone.
Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?
We’ll find another receptionist. I mean, that’s easy. We’ll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly]
[trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim’s legs]
Get up. All right? I’m not gonna let you by.
Then you know what? I’m just gonna have to run right through you.
OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn’t work.
[tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans]
[in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex.
[in feminine voice] And this is Sam.
[in a feminine voice] Kevin can’t come to the phone right now because he’s busy with us.
Perfect! Now people will think I’m doing hot girls all day.
I don’t know, man, they might think we’re drag queens.
Yeah, I don’t know why you picked names that are also guys’ names.
Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
This may be wrong. But there’s a limit to what I would do for my child.
Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man’s horsey.
No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I’ll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I’m even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is… hmph… that’s ah… so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]
[tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
Anything else you need to talk about?
Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
[looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it’s show time.
What baffles me is how you could take a perfectly good idea, [Dwight enters] which the great Jo Bennett rightfully signed off on, and then utterly botch it in execution.
If I may speak to that, I have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is Dwight Shrute.
I don’t see Dwight. He clearly had the infinite wisdom to stay as far away from this clown show as possible.
Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes… but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.
[to Nellie] Are you kidding? [to Robert] She’s the queen of the whole freaking Magilla!
What, you, I, I can’t get fired. I’m an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh? [Dwight exits meeting room and helps Jim up]
[Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They’re back. [Everyone greets them]
Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn’t lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
[to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.
I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]
There’s this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it’s not — it doesn’t sound cool. You just have to see it.
Well, I guess it doesn’t look that cool either. But, it’s been up there a long time, so it’s become a pretty big deal.
Did a good job, Buddy. Now it’s time to come home.
I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
How long do you think it’s been up there, Kevin?
I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, “Look, a balloon.”
My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
I was still thinking of going back to school.
And I was still just a paper salesman.
Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]
Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. [pops loudly] [cheers and applause]
Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
Allow me to solve your problem, then.
Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?
Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let’s build a shrine. No, I’ve come to work here.
How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I’m in an identical situation.
Robert did say you’d be joining us. Welcome. I’m Tony.
I- I said I’m Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I’m Toby.
It happens, okay? Uh, so let’s just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I’m sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.
I have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. It’s how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.
Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
Good morning Erin. [driving by delivering newspapers]
How are you? How’s your family doing?
Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That’s right. I’m a maid for an old lady. Her grandson’s staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away.
How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far?
Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous.
Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn’t it?
Now. Let’s find you something fun to do here, shall we?
Oh, I’ve already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.
Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I’ve been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.
Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning?
Huh. Yeah, that’s weird. He’s usually here by now. Right guys?
Andy, it’s Robert. Why aren’t you at work?
Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I’m super sick.
I don’t care, I don’t care. Please come to work immediately.
Okay, I’ll try to come in even though I’m really sick with the…
Not much we can do about this until he gets here.
Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim.
What is going on? And where’s Andy? And what is going on?
Where’s the postage? I mean, there’s no shipping label.
[screaming as Andy busts out of box]
[singing] Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I’m yours!
Andy, what are you doing here? It’s great to see you.
Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.
Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
Um, Andy… I am so happy to see you. But I’m not coming back with you.
[whispering off screen] Why won’t she go with him?
[whispering] I don’t know. Maybe it’s ’cause he’s not that handsome.
I think it’s a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It’s not a name.
So no one can tell me what’s going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. [in American accent] But why, m’lady? [in normal voice] Because I am your new manager.
[laughs] This is an odd situation. But it’s very interesting how it’s playing out.
We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone’s lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman?
I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.
How can you give us performance reviews if you don’t know us?
On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.
Erin, you really nailed the hot dogs today.
Oh, thanks. I’ve been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It’s only going to keep getting better.
So, Andrew, how does your skinny brunette girlfriend Jessica feel about you visiting your ex-girlfriend?
Well, we’re not really dating anymore, so… basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I’s, you know.
So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
I think you should leave, young man.
All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn’t want to stop until I saw you.
No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
[on phone message, singing] Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-
Oh, you’re doing so good. Oh my God, you’re superman over there. [Andy’s phone vibrating]
You should take it. It’s probably your girlfriend wondering where you are.
Nope. It’s just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I’m getting stronger.
You really wouldn’t feel those kinds of results after one session.
I don’t know. [phone vibrating] Just let it vibrate. It’s fine.
Just go to preferences, then click –
[answering Andy’s phone] Proctology.
I- I’m home in bed. I’ve been in bed all day. I got the– I got the serious poops, man.
He’s here in Tallahassee, trying to turn my life upside down.
What? You’re in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram’s trying to take your job.
Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
Okay… Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I’m not coming home without Erin. So I’ll talk to you later.
Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you’re basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn’t have to work?
I wouldn’t let her manage a celery farm.
And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat]
All right. Let’s get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.
Nellie, I’m sorry, but I don’t feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don’t know.
Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.
I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You’re getting a raise.
Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?
There’s no limit to what I think I deserve.
Money isn’t real ever since we got off the gold standard.
So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I’m fairly certain you’re going to like it.
So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.
Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there… all very impressive.
Um… are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.
Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown?
Land. World. Uh, it’s not that I don’t want a– well, yes, I guess I’d take a raise. That’s not what I’m saying. That’s not– sorry.
Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss.
Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?
When two animals are having sex, one of them…
… is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua– this isn’t very helpful. You’re gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor.
All life is sex. And all sex is competition.
And there are no rules to that game. That wasn’t so perverted, now was it?
My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn’t he decide who the manager is?
Mm, let’s see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.
I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it’s okay for someone to just take someone else’s job? Shouldn’t work like that.
No, you know what? Nellie’s right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I’m here. This is mine. Back off.
[Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
[panting] Well fought. I accept the outcome.
I’ve heard that’s amazing when it works.
Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other’s mouth. It’s just stupid. What were you going to say?
Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we’re not meant to be.
I’m so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.
So, Pamela, I’m going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.
Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager’s position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I’m easy.
That’s not really what you want. What you want is a good night’s sleep, working mother of two.
Whoa, that’s kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for– what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?
Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn’t is because I’m breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn’t like a bottle.
Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There’s a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I’ll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.
I think you’re amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: “I’m amazing.”
Erin, I think you’re making a big mistake right now. Andy is a nice boy.
Really? ’cause you’ve been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
I was protecting you because I thought he was no good. But I can tell you really like him. And he’s willing to lose his job for you, in this economy with Europe on the brink–
Irene, what would you do without me?
We’re not your concern, sweetheart. Besides, Glenn’s going to sue Home Depot.
He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture.
No, it’s not, because you don’t really work here.
Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn’t you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?
Yeah, that’s the thing. I don’t know if you can even give raises.
Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?
Mm-hm. I’m a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.
But here’s the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn’t exist.
She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?
Look at this wonderful recognition of Nellie’s leadership. I believe. [applause continues]
That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin’s favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It’s biodegradable. Animals will eat it.
Andy wait! [running down street] Andy! Andy wait! Don’t go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don’t love you. I’m sorry.
Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street]
Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.
You just use whichever one is sitting there?
I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.
It’s nice. It’s funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I’m not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
Oh, I don’t know. Now I think he doesn’t.
Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
Okay, the man’s worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
‘Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don’t stick our noses in other people’s business.
Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache]
Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
[bell dings] Guys, that’s the elevator. What if it’s him?
Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]
Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley’s face]
[reveals Stanley’s moustache] Ah! Ha ha ha!
Welcome back, Stanley. [Stanley grunts]
“Good morning, Robert,” says no one because our receptionist is in Florida. [no one responds] Pam!
Is this a video conference you’re having with “Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz”?
Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being-
Sorry, sorry, everyone, I’m late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.
[laughing] Nellie, really, nine fifty?
Oh, here’s what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.
Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse!
[laughs] I’ve never believed willpower was very important in a woman.
I don’t think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason.
Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.
No, no, no, no. There’s something going on. Some stress in your life.
Actually, Nellie, this monologue you’re delivering is very offensive.
oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!
Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans]
If you’d let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?
You’re clearly under a lot of… stress with the moving and the work situation you’ve found yourself in.
Let’s help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place.
The rest of you, let’s throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community.
I’m sorry, we’re throwing a party for someone because they’re being horrible?
I’m sorry, we’re taking work time to move someone’s personal belongings into their new apartment.
I’m still not sure why this woman is even here.
[sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life.
On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents’ cabin in southern Pennsylvania.
Mm-hmm. It’s a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.
Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.
I think that’s important. That is important. Bummer, but important.
I can’t believe he’s making us throw a party for her.
She’s always late, she’s always rude…
It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
[laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle]
…and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.
Well, Andy, I’m upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I’ll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
[vocalizing]  I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
Okay, here we go. Jessica, I’m really sorry. I just need you to know-
What is it? I didn’t sleep well last night. [they laugh]
Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? ‘Cause to be honest, I don’t think it’s gonna fit through the door.
Don’t listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? “Oh, I think I’ll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.”
I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let’s not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.
[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.
Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
That’s moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
So we’re planning this party for Nellie, and we’re gonna make it really bad.
No. We’re gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.
Wow. There’s a lot of cars here. This is just weird.
[knocks on car window] Andy! Hey, what are you doing here?
I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I’d stop and say hi to Jessica.
Why is Erin with me? That’s a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.
Nice to meet you. [Erin gasps at another girl outside her window] Well, Jess went out for a run but she’ll be back soon. Hey ladies, Andy’s here!
Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica’s friends and they’ve been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-
Oh, Jess! [claps] Look who stopped by after his business trip!
I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
[reads] “Nellie, don’t open, stupid. Love, Nellie.”
Here’s the two of them taking a hike. I’m guessing he’s some kind of friend.
Here’s the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I’m guessing he’s some kind of close romantic friend.
Yeah. Whoa. Here’s one with his face whited out.
Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he’s a hated Italian politician.
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
Oh, Nellie. I’m so sorry. We were just…
I see you’ve discovered Benjamin. That’s what I call my box full of photos of Henry.
God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.
That’s awful. What kind of restaurant.
I couldn’t afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what’s ten years of bliss down the drain  compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?
I’m so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don’t tell anyone about this.
No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or…
God, no. That’s the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?
[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let’s give up on all this mean stuff.
What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don’t have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.
Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It’s way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone]
We’re going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It’s gonna make everyone sick.
We discuss… [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean.
I knew she’d crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
We’re in far too deep. We can’t change course at this point.
What are you talking about? Yes we can.
What I mean to say is we don’t want to.
Toots, we’re not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
[pops balloon] Suck it! [cheers, applause]
It’ll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis?
No, uh, I’ll just have some gummy bears.
And we come to Matthew. The guy who was with his old girlfriend basically the whole time we were together. [party guests groan]
No, pop it. Pop it! [Lauren pops the balloon, party guests cheer]
You are one of the good ones, nard dog.
No, really. [to Jessica] Where’s my Andy?
Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so…
That’s not like you. That’s not like you. Come on, sing! Sing!
[singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes…
Okay, they’re almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie]
Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
Hey, that’s not a code name. That’s just an insult.
Plus everyone would know who you meant.
No, that’s a great idea. Let’s have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?
Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
‘Cause there’s someone already here named Pam.
Everybody get comfy now. This first song’s over a half hour long. [plays off-tune notes]
Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, “Have you heard my originals? They’re terrible.” They said, “Even better.” I said, “I get it. It’s an ironic party for Nellie.”
No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?
Well, first just let me say that I hope when I’m done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.
Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.
Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn’t relationship material and she wasn’t as good as me, but it’s her, isn’t it?
Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I’m gay.
You invited me to go shopping with you.
I like hanging out with you. You’re a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I’m gay.
Andy, you’re not gay. I mean, we were… together. And you seemed pretty excitable.
Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.
Well… I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-
Look, it’s fine, Andy. I didn’t think we were gonna get married or anything. I just… I’m just upset for now.
Understandable. And I’m really sorry. I really am. [hugs Jessica, grunts] So… we should probably… go.
This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent.
To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I’d be if Pam died. [laughter]
-that you guys hate Pam. Do you ever wish she would just… disappear? [sets off flash paper]
You know, that stuff that I said about you to her… I did- That’s just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.
Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah… I feel really tired.
When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you’re my volunteer. Come on over here, huh?
Oh! Big guy, huh? How’s the air up there? Watch out for… birds. [chuckles] All right, let’s uh- let’s do some card magic. Now, what I want you to do is… I want you to pick a card just by looking at it. Do not say what it is.
[picks a card] It’s the four of hearts.
Looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? No hablo el cardo, senor? Hmm? Ha. All right, the card is picked. Now sir, will you please shuffled the deck? [Jim drops the cards] You didn’t just do that on purpose, did ya?
[to Dwight] Why is Jim treating the magician poorly?
Little known fact about me. Before I was a magician, I used to work at a rope factory.
Not true. ‘Cause that’s not a real place.
But I never could seem to figure out those knots.
That’s not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.
[yells] What the hell? All right, where’s Phyllis? Who’s Phyllis? Look. This is really uncool, okay? I put on a clean show here-
Well Nellie, I’m sorry. If I’d known Jim and Pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician-
Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they’re brilliant employees, in their own way. Don’t you see what I see?
Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party.
You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]
Oh. Hello. Hey everybody, look who’s here.
Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I’m not gay. In fact, I’m so not gay, I’m in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she’s right there. She’s sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.
Why the hell did you come back here?
Get out! You ruined my party! Who does that? Are you kidding me? [Andy and Erin run to the car] Yeah, run away!
I can’t believe you’re not gay! [Andy and Erin kiss]
Don’t come back. [someone throws food at the car]
You don’t even know how to drive! Bye Andy! Loser! Nice car!
I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
Wait a minute! You said it was a magician, right? [Pam nods] You don’t think he could’ve used… it couldn’t have been…
Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
I actually sleep better when it’s raining.
Time’s almost up. How many are left?
Just one. “This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.”
Phyllis. This rain… does it make you wanna be doing something?
You know, like aren’t some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?
Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
And that’s noon. Exactly. [others groan]
I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody’s being so nice to me today.  I’m really happy being here.
[singing] My girlfriend’s back and there’s gonna be trouble-
[simultaneously] …his girlfriend’s back! [others cheer and applaud]
Anyway, I know it’s the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi.
[wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She’s sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
I’ve written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.
Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I’ve been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you’ve been hearing all about.
I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.
Anyway, now that I’m back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.
Obviously, we’ll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.
…and then just lay him in his crib, and then bicycle his legs. And then after Jim quiets down, you do the same thing with your baby. [Pam, Jim and Kelly laugh] But if he keeps having problems, just give me a call.
Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don’t want to bother you any more than we already have.
It’s no bother, you guys are our friends.
Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.
Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and… oh, that’s it.
Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they’d be good together.
[talks over flashbacks] Kelly has been a handful in the past.
[Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she’s had a bad influence. She’s like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean.
[Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar’s desk] Get lower.
Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
Sorry, just to be clear, you’re saying do NOT shake the baby.
Don’t shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated ’cause the baby’s crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can’t do that.
Okay. I’d never heard that before. So, thank you.
Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you’re into Indian people. I’m not.
Hey, um, what’s the deal with this guy? He’s really into Kelly, huh?
Yeah, they’re really great together.
Maybe we weren’t right together, but… it’s weird. I’d rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
Nellie! You’ve been terrific in your interim capacity. But, Andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office-
This is what I was trying to tell you.
I’m not accustomed to people saying no to me. [laughs]
Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.
You’re both adults. I’m sure you can figure this out between yourselves.
I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. So I find it best to excuse myself temporarily until I’ve had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. Buffett operates the same way.
I’m gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I’m going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.
Angela! Dock Andy’s pay one hundred dollars.
Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie’s pay a hundred dollars. Angela?
I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
I know what, let’s go… ten thousand dollars! [Andy laughs] Five… four…
You’re just saying numbers. It’s meaningless.
Two… [Andy runs out of the room] one.
There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we’re gonna have a nice, hot date.
Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn’t last night.
I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
God I don’t even remember what that fight was about.
You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
I’m in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don’t know how I’m gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
Did it affect you outside of the office?
I don’t know what the technical term is… Penial softiosis?
Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
He’s so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, “Kelly, that will be the color of our children.”
Yeah, he’s so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?
I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
Every day I brief Nellie on what’s going on in the office. Most of it’s irrelevant. But a good informer doesn’t judge what’s worth passing on.
Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
I just wanted to take the man’s job, not his manhood.
Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room.
You can’t call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let’s get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.
Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.
Oh! Can’t do it ’cause I gotta run a meeting. So.
Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance… and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.
Andrew, not everyone here is important. And the word is “impotence.”
Which is important in its own way. So if you’d just like to take a seat, Andy.
“Take a man’s job, but leave him his balls.” Margaret Thatcher said that… probably. Don’t know. Don’t read. Didn’t see the movie.
This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.
It’s not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
Oh, oh, it’s not me. No, no. I’ve never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.
Dwight couldn’t get it up for Nellie?
No, no, no, no, no, It’s not me. I’m gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]
Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it.
Fine, it was me. I couldn’t- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?
I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn’t perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It’s usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.
Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?
Uh… I have other issues. I’m terrible at math. Overweight. You- you’re in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
It seems Andy is the only one with this problem. Fascinating.
I don’t really see what the problem is. Erin doesn’t even like sex, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton.
Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?
Creed, you are a thousand years old.
Haven’t heard any complaints. Wouldn’t care if I did.
Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.
Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times.
Um… I don’t… Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we’d had sex so many times already, I was exhausted…
If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted ’til I was forty-four.
Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]
I’ve read- and I don’t know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help.
This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on.
You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.
Andy, why don’t you tell us about the best erection of your life? Or does anyone else have any remarkable erections they’d like to share? [Creed, Kevin and Meredith raise their hands]
Toby, doesn’t HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
Erin, HR is a joke. I can’t do anything about anything.
The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that’s a vicious spiral.
I almost didn’t come in today. [laughs]
[on the phone] Dad, don’t think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don’t think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn’t been decided yet.
Erin, on phone memos you’re writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional.
Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don’t like the way that I take phone messages, here! [throws phone] Take ’em yourself!
Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses!
And Andy is the manager, not Nellie!
Stop protecting me! I’m a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I’m sorry! I don’t mean to lash out at you! There’s a lot coming up right now, all at once! [into phone] Dad go to hell, I’m taller than you!
You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit.
Andy, why don’t you just take a seat?
Why don’t you take a seat, you idiot? [throws chair]
And why don’t you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
And your stupid face! [grabs Nellie’s photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground] And your stupid office! [punches hole in the wall] Ah!
Maybe we’ll get sent to anger management together.
That would actually be cool. I’d love for you to meet some of the guys.
Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
Well that’s your opinion and it’s her opinion, but it’s not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
Fair enough. Um… I don’t think you’re a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I’ve said this to you before: I don’t like you very much.
Well a lot of people would say that I’m a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi’s way better.
Yeah. Man, you’re insane right now. Ravi’s the whole package.
I’ve never met Ravi personally, but I’m gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I’ve never even met the guy.
Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can’t even read it. My heart couldn’t handle it.
Read it, please. I love amazing poetry.
No. It would cause me too much pain.
Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
Yeah, man, he’s absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
Andy, we’re going to go with Nellie as manager and put you back on the sales team. I promise you, in time, we’ll all laugh about this incident. I already think it’s kind of funny. [chuckles]
[sees Ryan on the horse] Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!
Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don’t interrupt.
What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
Turn around. Turn around. Turn around!
Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.
You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
That was really cool. [they make out]
Well, it’s good to see Kelly’s maturing.
Look, Andrew, we can discuss the specifics of the job.
It’s the apology. I really have to insist.
Andrew, if you say no one more time, you’re fired. So… is there anything else you wanna say?
I can’t describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel… alive.
Here- [grabs the box Andy’s holding]
You’re not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan’s soul?
“Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches.”
“And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.”
It’s just so dumb. [chokes up] But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft…
Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I’m the first to know.
Wow That’s terrible, I really liked him.
I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?
Oh God, Nellie! What wasn’t his? I mean, um, “Tracks of my Tears”?
No, no, no, “Tracks of My Tears” and what else? What are some more? What’s one more?
Okay, I’m not… I’m not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
I don’t think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you’re just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
Okay, I’m sorry I’m not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It’s on CNN as of two minutes ago.
Wow! Look at that! It says he’s actually playing State College. That’s only three hours away!
Oh my God, Ryan! That’s perfect! You have to go!
250 dollars is nothing to the world’s biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don’t think I can see this.
Okay, you could just show up late though.
How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That’s not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
Don’t call me a clown, Pam. You’re better than that!
Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I’m being strangled like I’m at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick’s?
Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight… I’m sure it will be fine.
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who’s who of the northern 22nd district!
I don’t want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
Well, as long as you don’t want to alarm people…
There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
Oh that’s Andy. He’s just hanging out
That’s how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male “hanging out”. Call the cops!
Dwight, I don’t think he’s going to hurt anybody.
How do you? I mean, why do you think he’s there?
I don’t even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I’m going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I’m gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I’d be murdered.
Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
because he fired you which means apparently you’re living in your car now.
guys, everything is fine! I’m just here to pick up Erin. We’re going to the Fundraiser.
Wait, what? You’re going to the fundraiser tonight? That’s going to be weird.
It’s going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
Hey, I hear you! I hope you’re right. It just seems like it’s going to be really, really weird.
You really re-did Andy’s office, huh?
Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.
I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
You could go downstairs and ask them?
The warehouse isn’t downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it?
Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?
Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! [hugs Robert and laughs.] I had you, I had you!
[points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It’s been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What’s the question? How am I doing? Umm… Great!
Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one’s raping this guy!
Well, I don’t want to get raped [picks up clipboard] Twenty-Two!
[Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you’re going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
Whoa, Dwight, I don’t think you understand.
You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
So Dwight doesn’t understand silent auctions. I guess he’s the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn’t have one!
What haven’t I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I’m writing, though it feels more like I’m receiving it than writing it.
Wow, that’s exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that’s shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!
You know, Oscar, I really had no idea you were so passionate about animals.
really? Well, if you want to get involved, call me. This is my cell. I’m more likely to pick up night, say after 9… Excuse me. [Walks away.]
This confirms three things: I’m right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
[telling story to Nellie.] I stepped in right away and start–
Bobby! Bobbo! You’re a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?
You gotta check out this thing I’m working on, it’s really cool. There’s this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can’t control.
So, Thomas Oregon is an evil figure?
Evil! [chuckles.] although he’s humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
Me, I guess. [sings.] We’re flying so high, we’re crackin’ the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!
She’s right, Andy. you’re being a jabroni
Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don’t you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight?
Don’t need you to pay for me. I’m doing just fine, thank you. Why don’t you quit harshing our mellow?
[to Waiter.] Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please.
I’m sorry, the tables are sold as complete units.
And a high five! [Raises hand, misses high five with waiter.] Oh, let’s do this again!
[waiter is cracking pepper into Andys salad] Oh, yes indeed… When! [Waiter begins walking away.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! [waiter peppers another salad.] When!
I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
Okay, Oscar, I’m not saying you’re not dreamy, because you are, but isn’t it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]
Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn’t Downton Abbey.
Here’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to go over there and I’m going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
[on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
How you doing, I’m great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?
No, best thing that ever happened to me.
That’s the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.
Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!
Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers… Or Oreos… Or a pizza pie or, what’s another food that we like?
What I wouldn’t give for a big mess of tacos right now!
Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we’d probably need about what 20… $20? Or $25? $20?
I’ve never eaten a taco. I’m not entirely sure what they are. As long as they’re not slimy, and please god don’t let them have eyes!
[Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
Boom! [hands Oscar a business card.]
what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Or you proved that he thinks you’re gay.
He does not think Jim’s gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
Before we bring out our guest of honor tonight, we are very proud to introduce a great philanthropist and a great guy. Robert California!
Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason!
The state senator, Robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes! [laughter.]
Not a joke. That was not even a joke.
I will! I will take all of those dogs!
No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it’s not that complicated.
Andy why don’t we discuss this at a–
Okay! Hope you all learned something!
I’m so ready to love all of these animals. This one’s even bonding with me already.
Uh, no. Kenny’s a therapy dog. He apparently thinks you’re in some kind of emotional crisis.
Well, if you would like to talk about this some more, my office is always open! So here’s my office number, and my cell number.
Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i’m Sorry Oscar.
sorry about what? There’s nothing to be sorry about here.
No. I’m certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I’d have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
Oh, great! Okay, oh… Oh, these tacos!
Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm… Oh! Hmmph!
The winner of the three day trip to the sky top lodge is Dwight Schrute!
The yearlong membership to Scraton-Bikram Yoga is Dwight Schrute!
A one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to Dwight Schrute!
[applause] Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!
Well, I think I can save us some time, Dwight Schrute has won every single item here!
Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
Well, Dwight, yes! You certainly are a record breaker! Your donation is the largest we’ve ever received at over 34 thousand dollars! [applause]
Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
It was lovely! And don’t forget to call.
why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
[applying diaper to dog.] so it just goes on under here like this?
Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
He’s great. we’re all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I’m a dog nurse.
Look at that one though, he’s smiling!
Yeah, he should be! It’s his first day without a muzzle.
This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
I’m sorry, are you guys nuts? He’s not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
You’re right. he’s right, I am a mess. This whole night I’ve been trying to convince you guys that I’m fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I’m fine, maybe–
Maybe you would think it too! [silence.] I’m sorry, it’s just I don’t get to be in a lot of human conversations.
Okay well, Andy, listen. It’s okay if you don’t feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!
Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It’s been great!
Pepper’s been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
My dog Ruby doesn’t do anything, she just lays there all day! She’s so chill.
Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She’s so dainty!
Doesn’t really poop. It’s perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
She smells horrible. It’s unbelievable. But I don’t want to put her in the bath, because I’m afraid that she’ll drown.
People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they’re just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They’d flex them all night at the discotheque.
Oh, I bet you think it’s all about core, huh?
Core’s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One – lengthen. Two – elongate.
Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who’s the strongest? Well, there’s only one way to solve that – flat curl contest.
All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
Come on, Gabe, you can’t handle his hamstrings. You’re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over]
Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot… these.
You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
Andy, if you’re gonna hang out for a while, uh…
This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
Is this Robert’s attempt to embarrass me?
No, of course not. It’s just – I think it’s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it’s like, where does it end? So just… [puts visitors tag on Andy]
Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they’re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it’s a little much? …Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that’s what it feels like.
All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
And they said it couldn’t be done. Boom!
Lot going on guys. What’s happening?
Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It’s like a festival of poo.
Yeah, and we’re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
Sorry, man, I can’t focus on zingers. There’s too many potential clients.
Yeah, the Syracuse branch can’t be happy you’re taking New York clients.
Can everyone just, please… I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and – how should I say this – Columbian whites. What – what is this about, uh, Binghamton?
Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I’m not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.
I got your voicemail. From – from last night.
And the answer… is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]
Pam, when’s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn’t hold the memories in?
Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.
Yes, ‘course. Why don’t you list the things that would keep you from helping me.
Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute?
Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?
Harry Jannerone, Dunder Mifflin Syracuse.
Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.
You live well down here in P.A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one’s that guy?
The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to – how do I put this – steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
[pointing at Toby] There he is. That’s Lloyd.
Where do you get off crossing state lines?
Now, we’re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn’t back down from anybody. And he calls people “Kimosabe”.
They’re New York. We’re New York. State line is the dividing line. That’s the way it’s always been.
There’s actually not a rule that says that.
That’s true. There’s no rule. You can check the employee handbook.
Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could’ve choked so many people by now.
Stay out of my state. It’s in your best interest to stay out of my state.
I’ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside]
How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
Robert’s here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don’t think we were doing that.
Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim’s leg.
Where’s the Advil, Jim? I think I’ve hit my limit on the Tylenol – Oh.
Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?
Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
Robert California. What a surprise you’re here in Scranton.
So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place?
No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead.
Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There’s no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems… so poorly timed.
Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
Listen, Robert, I don’t have time. There’s a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions –
Prestige is ours. Okay, they’re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said… [Andy walks out]
Is it just me or is our boss a freakin’ weirdo? [stands up, walks outside] I’m gonna get some air.
Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
[Gets up and looks out Nellie’s office window] He’s running!
Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It’s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That’s it? Oh, that’s great. That’s like a five second delay.
Come on, let’s go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.
Seriously? ‘Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
So…what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
: [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don’t worry, I won’t lay an egg.
: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]
: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.
Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I’m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.
Do you think I’d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
Uh, I think you’re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. [chuckles] It’ll be upsetting if you don’t.
I’m a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.
Why haven’t I heard of you? You got any references?
Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now… [pulls out business card] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.
Every salesman I’ve ever met has given me his personal phone number.
Of course they have. Which is why I’m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need – anytime, night or day – you just stop on by.
You want me to drive to your house if I need paper.
Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe… you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]
[Running] Ahhh! [Slides into elevator]
Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh.
[Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
I don’t even know where the stairs are!
[Dwight jumping] What are you doing?
I’m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We’ll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down.
My pants fell down! I don’t have a belt!
Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse –
I already made an appointment… with your secretary.
Let me stop you all right here. I’ve already picked a new paper supplier.
No, no, it’s not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. It’s… Big Red Paper Company.
Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
All right, guys. It didn’t work out for any of us, so… we’re still on the same team. Let me get these.
No. Let him get his own. It’s Syracuse money.
You know, your partner’s got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?
Jim couldn’t land me in a thousand years.
Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.
Now we get to the bottom of Nellie’s “yes, yes, yes, yes, never.”
Hi, Nell, it’s mom. Do keep your chin up. It can’t be as bad as you described.
This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections.
Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you?
This is Annie from second nests. I’m sorry, but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, we’re gonna hold out for that.
Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.
Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They’re all deleted.
Pam, Pam, you’ve completely bungled this!
Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
Um… yes. Definitely. With your hair –
Certainly. Um… you dropped your cell phone.
No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
You’ve just got me started. Robert… is… a filthy beast. I mean, don’t you get the feeling, he’s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?
I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.
But sometimes he talks about flesh… and bacchanals.
I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
No… don’t. Just put it out of your mind.
Pam, what is your address? I’m gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don’t –
Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.
Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And… I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
[in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don’t, and I will find another buyer.
Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house]
Um… I’m in the middle of a piano lesson.
I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
Dunder Mifflin. [closes door] Now… why would I want that? It’s worth half of what it was three years ago.
Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
Why don’t you come in? [Andy walks in, closes door]
So what would you do if you weren’t selling paper?
Oh, man, I’d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don’t even care about nationals.
I don’t know. I’ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
I’d like to sell one big thing, you know? Like… a plane. One sale, I’m out.
Anyway, Robert’s gonna run this company into the ground, so… We won’t be doing this in six months.
No, it’s just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there’s a brighter future ahead.
No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
Just keep chatting. I’m just checking my makeup in your webcam.
Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.
Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it’s a simple-
No, I’m sorry, I just can’t sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist-
-pep talk. Sexuality is a spectrum. It’s a paradox to think of any sexual activity as “normal.” It gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated.
Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin’s nose] Ooh! [whimpers]
In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better… but better.
I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, “muffin basket.” Then I thought, “What’s even more precious to people than muffins?”
Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We’d love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don’t you bring by your little angel?
Jim, you’ve got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.
I know why you’re doing this, Dwight.
Last week, I may have gone too far. I’ll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And… you can fill in the rest.
[Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!
Now he’s trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it’s fair to be cautious.
Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
Aw, come on. What’s the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?
Come on, man. Can’t you just give us a yes or a no?
I don’t know, man. Y’all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y’all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn’t give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
[whimpering] I’m- I’m good, thank you. And how are you?
Look, I’m not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I’m moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants…
Why don’t you clean the carpets for today?
You’re welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is.
Good, good. This carpet’s overdue for a good mopping.
Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
Mmm, I can’t hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o’clock today he’s gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.
[enters with the kids] Family picture!
No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight’s photo studio slash trap.
Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
We decided that there’s no way Dwight would harm a child.
But are you a hundred percent sure? I don’t think any of us are.
But it’s free. And we’ll keep our eye on them.
And we’ll make sure Dwight doesn’t do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
Sir, could you look into the camera?
Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good.
Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
Hi, you know, my office got a call that they were shooting family portraits right here. And if there’s one thing that every politician instinctively understands, it’s a good photo op.
Okay, you’re going to go through the hallway. Here’s a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]
Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.
No. I am going to hold him because I haven’t seen him all day.
I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby’s DNA to prove he’s the father. Which… is impossible… because the senator is the only man I’ve ever been with.
Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby’s hairs are out of place.
[slaps Dwight’s hand away] No. No. I like the baby’s hair the way it is.
This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] It’s go time.
Hey Nellie, I made soup – I made you some soup.
But it’s really good- [drops soup] Oh!
I know this is going to be a great payoff.
But after you’re manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don’t want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby’s fingernails are just bothering me-
I guess we’re okay with the fingernails.
Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby’s cheek distracting to you as well?
Oopsie, did somebody make a boopsie?
I’m just gonna take him out and change him just for a second.
That’s some pretty blatant complementing you’re doing there, man. I don’t even talk to her like that.
Sounds like you’re trying to hit on my girlfriend.
Yes, I am. Just so everyone’s on the same page.
[scoffs] So you really think she’s gonna leave a guy who owns his own restaurant for a dude who ate his own restaurant?
I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.
You’re dirty, you stink of booze, you’re limping inexplicably.
I just want you guys not to worry. ‘Cause old Andy’s gonna be just fine.
No, no, see? This is what we’re talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you’re not drunk…
No, unfortunately it’s true. He’s been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he’s been taking it out on me.
No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.
He’s not hitting me. But, he’s been verbally abusing me-
That’s not true either! That’s also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you’re gonna like this surprise guest.
I can refer you to someone to talk to.
I’m not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.
David Wallace hasn’t worked here in years.
Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum “Suck It” to the U.S. military.
I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.
Hey, Andy, Nobody’s calling you crazy, Andy. We’re your friends, Andy.
Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
Erin, come- Come on. You know I’ve been talking to David Wallace.
Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?
[into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
Now you look at me like you’re adoring me, I’m gonna look at the camera like I don’t even know you’re there.
Andrew, it’s time for you to go home. You’re better than this.
Everyone’s better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. [drinks coconut penis energy drink] Why’d they add coconut? I miss original.
Is it true you’re buying the company?
Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I’ve been talking with Andy-
What? Thought I heard my name. What? I’m the new manager?
That’s quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.
There’s an official announcement, a few details to be-
From total loss to total boss, I mean-
Can we expect any payroll interruptions?
Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-
I was so looking forward to that and it did not… go as I thought it would.
So we’re not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett’s planning on liquidating the rest of the company.
Oof. [laughs] Wouldn’t wanna be a Sabre employee right about now. [laughs] I’m actually the CEO.
Ah, I didn’t realize you were standing there.
Hey, my friend, trust me. This is for the best. I never understood that corporate mess.
I’d love to give you a little rundown on what I’ve learned about this place.
That’s very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that.
Guess I’d better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.
Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
[taking photo with Jada] Let’s see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val]
Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.
It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever’s on your mind.
The quality of mercy is not strained.
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. ‘Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
Special projects manager, that’s my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.
All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?
Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there’ll be no need for him.
But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he’s gonna be freed up to do something much more important.
I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.
Gymnasts? You’re going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?
Yeah, so I’m hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. Well, Andy, it’s been fun.
Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips]
How long does it take to get the results?
Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand]
[Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can’t do this. Dwight!
Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me…
You know what this is about. [covers Phillip’s eyes] Call.
Mr. Schrute, the results are in. You are not the father.
I told you [Dwight vomits power drink on Angela]
Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I’m not that good at puzzles.
[as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesn’t go there. [Kevin shushes him]
For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.
You are really good at modesty. She’s a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids’ room. There’s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children—
Kay, well, you had that interesting thing.
Yes, Jim’s friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.
Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.
In Philly, so, that doesn’t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
He said if it takes off he’s gonna buy us a new car.
Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fiancé Ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at Miami university.
[tossing out winter coats] I don’t need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.
Miami University in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it
Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons.
I’ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It’s a big university town. And, uh, that’s not garbage, it’s out clothes.
Don’t you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.
Well we’re more following you guys, to see how you turn out.
Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don’t think anything’s gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there’s just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.
Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out?
Oh, my god. It’s called a garbage can.
There’s two new guys back there with me now. They’re in their 20s. And we really get along.
[Playing computer game with Toby] You’re looking good.
Just three single guys. Getting into trouble.
They’re like the new Jim and Dwight.
No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith’s face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
Andy’s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy’s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy’s here. Pam, he’s here. [squeals as Andy walks in]
Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it’ll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!
It sounds amazing, tell us all about it.
You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.
See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It’s Clark and, um—
In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.
Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.
Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.
No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.
Whoa! Mind blown. It’s like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?
Yes, yes I am. [puts his arm around Clark]
Dwight, Jr! [Dwight gives Clark a noogie]
In a way it’s like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they’ll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I’ll have a grandson.
Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.
The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
Angela’s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can’t eat cats. You can’t eat cats, Kevin.
No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look [starts playing video on computer]. He’s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants
I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
Those guys always change back, Angela.
David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.
Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive.
Yeah, I gotta go David. [hangs up phone] Why is Nellie still here?
Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you.
Can’t. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean?
Now I know why Michael hated you so much.
Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!
Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?
I think I’m busy that night. Or I would.
Well, we’re both just kinda learning as we go, aren’t we?
Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.
So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?
Is this—is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that’s totally fine. Like, I’m fine with it. But you should know that I’m into the ladies.
You know, if you’re ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you.
So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven’t had time to pursue yet?
You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
Cause you’re interested in going into sales?
Wow, that’s great. That’s great. Ok, good, let’s talk about that, ok?
You’re not getting my clients! Nice try.
Paranoid? I’m not familiar with the word. And I really don’t have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
The new guys. Dwight Jr is after  my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
The new guys called a sales meeting?
Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
There’s no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
You should ask him. It’s a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.
Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn’t given me a definite yes or no.
I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It’s going to be terrible.
No I’m going to make sure that it is. And if it isn’t, I’m going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don’t like to throw around the b-word, but I’m going to be a huge bitch to you.
I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.
If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you’ll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.
That’s me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete’s foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.
Ah, I like the Red Sox. I’m from Vermont.
Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends.
Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?
I’m very self-conscious about my feet.
Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! [pushes Nellie off slack line] You suck. Alright, who’s next? Darryl?
This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.
Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.
Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa! Look at this guy.
I’ve always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears.
Boo, unimpressed. It’s a tightrope for babies. Boo!
Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.
Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?
You got this, it’s all you. [as Dwight repeatedly fails and gets smacked around] Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It’s not a race, Dwight.
Well it’s official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.
[bleeding heavily from the mouth] That’s not true.  Just give me another chance.
This is a bloodbath. Alright, I’m calling this.
It is enough of this. Everyone, let’s go back to work.
This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.
Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn’t seem so macho now, does it? It’s a jump rope!
Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.
[sees trapeze contraption] What are you doing?
How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night.
Well, I’m still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list.
Oh, come on, Pete! God, that’s just sad. If he doesn’t watch himself, he’s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it’s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn’t you say?
Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.
Yes, and there’s nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.
Find someone else, I don’t know. Ask Phyllis.
I can’t use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I’ll be launched into space. God, you’re so insensitive.
No, the baby. Please, it’s my husband’s favorite cat. He’s broken up about it. It’s the only time I’ve seen him cry other than our wedding night.
You know what? I will take Comstock.
I’ll come by after work and pick him up.
Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won’t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight
[on phone] Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
Yeah. You know what? I’ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I’m about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!
Hey, man. It’s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don’t. I’m in. Yeah, yep, I’m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!
Woo! [starts pedaling out until trapeze bike flips over, he dangles from the handlebars] Ahh!!
Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would—[hit in the face with trash]
Oh, it’s nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are.
There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.
Well, it doesn’t spin. We’ll just move the wheel one notch each morning and… you see what chore you get that day.
Yeah, you know, like [motions arm in circles] guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh… guh.
No, I’m familiar with spinning. It’s just that wouldn’t work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-
[interrupting] Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.
[reluctantly] Spinning would be more fun.
[spinning a new ‘chore wheel’ while everyone claps] Okay, that’s what I’m talking about! Big money, big money! [wheel stops on ‘mug duty’, disappointed] Mug duty?
Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.
Yeah, seriously, it’s like everything on there is work.
I don’t think you guys understand why we’re doing this. It’s-
Yeah, I don’t think that you understand wheels.
[everyone cheers as Meredith spins and lands on ‘tiny wheel’] The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It’s so cute no one seems to mind.
[referencing the ‘tiny wheel’] Toilets! [everyone cheers as Meredith accepts her chore]
Yeah. I’m afraid he’s only gonna have hot dogs.
Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.
[as Pete and Clark enter office] Oh, Pete, you’ve got mail.
Well, it’s addressed to Customer Service so, it’s your mail.
Well, you know, I’m also Customer Service.
Yeah, I’m alternating. [gestures both men]
[sarcastically] Yay, another person yelling at me.
Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.
[looking down at Erin’s desk] Wow, Newsweek, huh? This election… thing is crazy, right?
[referring to the letter] It’s open.
Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It’s not a nice letter.
[distributing paperwork to the office] Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived.
Today, I launch my big charity initiative ‘Operation Give Back’. Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I’d like to see him piss on that one.
[at Roy’s wedding] Darryl! Ha-ha! What’s happening?
[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?
Would you like me to take your peel?
[embarrassed] Yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel]
[as Jim receives and declines a call] Who’s that?
With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports.
[grinning] Oh boy! What’s happening?
There’s four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley?
Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. [to Nellie] I’m sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?
[excited] Heifer’s International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It’s a great prank.
I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes.
I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives.
I’m not doing it for you. I’m doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.
Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.
Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.
Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
[everyone groans] Oh, for goodness’ sake, Dwight.
The Taliban is the worst. Great heroine, though.
Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back.
Well, it looks like there won’t be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You’re welcome. [wads up Nellie’s charity sheet and tosses it toward her]
[approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It’s, everyone’s just been so nice.
Come on. If it wasn’t for you, I never would’ve met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one. [sees Jim’s reaction] Just kidding.
By the way, man, this place is… beautiful.
Started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it’d take off?
Yeah. What about you? What are you doing?
Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
Hey bro, stop wasting time with this haircut. [referring to Jim] He’s got a fifty-thousand dollar sports car. Cheers.
Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.
Well, I got a buddy that’s a big time local news producer and I can’t tell you his name, but it’d blow your mind.
He’s looking for on-air talent and he’d kill me if I didn’t get you on tape.
No, Clark’s not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn, and Rob. But, you don’t know them.
I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?
You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it. [sits in front of piano]
[clapping] You got this, Roy. [Roy begins playing and singing She’s Got a Way by Billy Joel, Pam and Jim looked shocked, Phyllis and Bob begin making out]
[in the car] We still surprise each other.
You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-
Yes. But, what I didn’t tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn’t go because it was-
In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. [long pause] Do we know everything about each other?
Tell me one thing about you I don’t know.
[laughs] Um, ok. [thinks but says nothing]
[in the kitchen] Oh, here’s one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-
And you thought you guys were millionaires.
Yes. But there’s, wait, oh, there’s a funny ending to that story. I can’t remember.
That I thought we were millionaires.
Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That’s funny. Shoot, I knew that one.
The senator and I still have mystery. I’m always waiting to see what he’s gonna surprise me with next. [Oscar chokes on his coffee]
You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you’re willing to live by their rules here.
Anything else would be inconsistent.
Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? [offers Dwight a contract]
[takes contract] Absolutely, I will.
I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. [in a fake English accent] You don’t have a plan.
When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan.
[holds up pen as Dwight searches his desk] Looking for this?
What the? [follows Nellie into the break room]
Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it’s mine now because I stole it.
Didn’t you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there’s been theft. That means, you’re not serious or… someone’s getting their hand cut off.
I know. So, it’s better that you pick another charity.
Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.
In that case, you… [pulls out a cleaver] will have to chop off my hand.
[considers then takes cleaver] This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you’ll miss the most.
I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people’s hands.
[in his office] Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?
[entering annex] Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition?
Uh… couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut.
Yeah, industry secret. You’re gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back.
And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so-
Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take Erin to the mall and get that stuff.
Pff. Guess I’ll just head over to the mall then. Buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits.
That Clark, huh? Errr [punches palm] Ca!
[in kitchen with several people around] Next question for our oldie-weds-
What’s the craziest place you’ve ever made whoopie?
Who was Pam’s first celebrity crush?
[as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos.
Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-
Johnny Depp. [everyone looks confused toward Toby]
[after awkward pause] Sh, uh, um, I was having this separate conversation with Kevin. Uh, Johnny Depp.
OK, I have one. I have one. [Jim’s phone rings and he motions he’s taking the call elsewhere]
[while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place you’ve ever made whoopie?
[as Pam wonders about Jim] Kevin, stop it with that question.
[in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what’d they say? That’s awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!
It’s not even real yet. And I’m not gonna tell her ’til it’s real.
I think maybe there actually is something I don’t know about Jim.
Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin’s confidence.
Her body. We’re gonna talk about her body. [to Darryl] Good. Great job.
Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I’d be into The Godfather ’cause I’m black. Wrong! I’m into The Godfather ’cause I’m a cinephile. I like Scarface ’cause I’m black.
[to a full conference room] Erin has an audition to be a newscaster. [general acknowledgement]
Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl.
OK, um, I like Erin’s hair. It’s a very pretty color.
I’m sorry. This is for a news audition?
Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy.
I’m so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America – Walter Cronkite.
Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I’d take that mustache ride.
Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or…
She’s gonna be amazing. Look at her. She’s gonna light up the screen.
This is a first for me. And, I don’t get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.
[whispering to Pete] Whatever it takes.
[whispering] Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard.
[places Nellie’s hand on a board and holds up cleaver] This is it. Any questions?
No. It’s gonna be over before you know it.
[pretending to read news] Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren’t you glad you waited? Karzai commented.
A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn’t think I knew current events.
I love it. It’s fantastic. Now, tag it with your name.
For Channel 11 news, I’m Erin Hannon.
For Channel 11 news… I’m Erin Hannon.
Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don’t be shy.
Got it. For Channel 11 news… [very long pause]
OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there.
[as Pam stares at him] I can feel you looking at me.
OK. Well, here’s something you don’t know. A couple of weeks ago-
[after a pause] That didn’t happen. You would’ve told me right away.
Yeah, I would’ve. What about you? Come on, there’s gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven’t had the chance to tell me.
[looks knowingly back] Just tell me.
God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
Heh! Ha! [making various sounds and movements while preparing to severe Nellie’s hand] [Darryl enters, sees what’s happening, and quietly exits]
Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how Erin relates to the other people on the news team.
The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone.
Now, I’d say Clark could be your co-host… he’s already doing camera.
Someone who’s already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don’t know. [Andy smiles at camera]
Ha! [raises cleaver] This is for real this time.
It’s getting late. I thought you guys could use a little [sets up laptop] inspiration.
[Darryl hits play] Oh, a movie. What is this?
[answers his door to find Erin, Andy and Pete] Hey! Everybody.
Sorry, man. Andy though Erin needed a co-anchor. I’m his makeup guy. My hands are tied.
[news anchor audition] The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
[also as anchor] Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.
Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.
All right. We got that. That’s a rap, everybody.
No, I just, I don’t mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn’t feel good about that.
Great! Let’s get some food. I’m starving.
I don’t think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing.
Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something?
Hey, even if this doesn’t work out for me, I’m just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it’ll work out for Andy.
[as he and Nellie watch the movie] Oh god.
If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
Well, he’s a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time.
Whoopty doo. That doesn’t make you a genius.
Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid.
Who am I? I’m Jim. We’ve been working together for twelve years. Ha, Weird joke, Dwight.
You seriously never noticed? Hey, hats off to you for not seeing race.
Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don’t you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?
Uh, Wellington systems? Sold them 10 cases of 24-pound letter stock. Or, were you talking about Krieger-Murphy? Because I didn’t close that one yet, but I’m hoping I’ve got a voicemail from Paul Krieger waiting for me.
How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
Dwight, cut it out, I’m trying to work.
You don’t work here! You’re not Jim!
Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico’s at 7:30.
Jim’s at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.
I don’t know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
Oh my—! Oh d—! Oh, how did—? [gasps] Huhhhhh!
It’s all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!
[speaking in French] S”il vous plait…dites-Moi…Ugggghhh les Bleagh!
Ah, French. It’s a great language. If you’re a chain-smoking acrobat.
I’m just trying to fit in better with Andy’s family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I’m there!
You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
I could teach you if you want. It’s a lot easier than French.
It means “excellent”. And we have begun.
[asks Nellie who is tapping a pen on her desk]. Is everything okay?
Hmm? Oh—oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine.  I’m mean, I d—I just don’t wanna—burden you with my massive stress freak outs!
[yells] Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here.
Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior!  [hugs Pam]
[to Jim] I’m sorry, I’m leaving you alone for lunch.
Don’t worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I’ve been wanting to try.
This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn’t give you paper cuts. We can’t. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com
Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights.
Well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama!
Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children.
This is super-flattering. She’s the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.
My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.
I was intimidated by Andy’s family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She’s gonna be like, “What’s your stance on politics?” Or, “What is the best war to do?” And, I will just be like, “Duhhhh!”
Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh…I’m related to Michelle Obama.
Yeah we noticed early on, Andy really appreciates enthusiasm.
So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.
It’s starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome.
Yeah, me too. It’s weird. Hard to remember what’s real at this point.
You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ‘em all at once, you save a lot of time. It’s called batching.
Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me—[gets interrupted by Andy].
[shushing Jim] Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady?
Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
It’s me! [chuckles] I am related to Michelle Obama.
[chuckles in agreement] Huh ha! That’s cool, man.
Darryl said, “Cool, man.” He called me as cool man.
You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.
Mmmm—the thing is Pam, I’m gonna be eating while I’m driving, so, I might as well get good at it.
Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
I’m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
You think that Andy’s family owned slaves?
Well somebody owned somebody. And I don’t think anybody would buy an Andy.
[in a barbaric growl] Forth aggenda!
Louder! You’re shouting it from the back of a horse!
Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?
[laughs mischievously] Yeeeeahhhh! It’s almost unbelievable!
Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately.
Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up!
So he’s not related to Michelle Obama?
Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer.
Nellie’s pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
[whispers] Pam! [she pretends to slam a wrench over the tire service guy’s head].
Well, if there’s another explanation, I don’t really see what it could possibly be. I—[gets cut by Andy barging into the convo]
What’s going on here? I’m related to the first lady, okay? Get over it. [chuckles] I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! [Mimicks smacking everyone with a whipl].
Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
Why? Is it employee’s day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.
Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain… negative connotations. Most likely, your family were—slave owners.
Does anyone else think it’s possible that I come from slave owners?
Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
Hey mom, it’s Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about America’s national shame, thanks, Bye.
Huh huh huh. Look, I’m not gonna lie to ya, I’m a teensy bit distracted right now.
Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn’t be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.
[snaps his fingers] Right on, brotha. Wurddd.
Daraas!  [asks the rest of the office] Does anyone here have fermented mare’s milk?
Oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work.
Yeah—turn signal. It’s exciting to be painting again—those are the wipers. So—the—its—just. There you go! Yeah. [chuckles]  Yeah, things get so busy with the kids—red light—that it’s nice to have that creative outlet—red light! Red light! Red! Red!
That is brilliant, Pam. I would love to see some of your work.
Well, since we’re stopped at a light, uhhh, here is…the mural I did for Angela’s baby.
That’s amazing, Pam! Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo!
Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
[to Erin]. Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?
So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I’m trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.
Not my slaves, my ancestors’. Maybe. Probably not.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for “slave master”, “attafrauk!”, is a term of respect. I’m learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
That you’re learning a made-up language from HBO’s Game of Thrones?  I have a lot going on today…but this was a great nerd-out!
Dwight, you didn’t tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
Good. Very good. [cell phone beeping]Oh—no! Here. It’s, uh, a text from Andy. “New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P.” And then in parentheses, he wrote out “as soon as possible.”
Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back, “looking for dirt.”
Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding.
No! I’m just practicing my lyyiiinggg! [whispers] I love it.
Ummm. Oh! I’ll say he’s related to Richard Nixon. It’s an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.
My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma. [pauses] I just made a joke there.
I’m sorry. It’s just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there’s something Jim isn’t telling me.
Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!
You’re a cocky little thing, aren’t you, Pam?
I’ve done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I’m not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol’ family closet. For example, Phyllis’s great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States.
Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.
You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon!
Pam always says I look like Nixon. That’s crazy, right? I mean there’s nothing there. True—[touches his nose] Oh no.
Dwight’s grandfather was a—[is interrupted by Dwight].
Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So…[clears throat]
I was gonna say he was a tax evader.
Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!
And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden.
Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [mimics stabbing into Angela’s throat]
Stop it! Stop it! You’re frightening me!
Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
Yeah, that—you’re being really mean, Andy.
No, I’m proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it’s in the past and it’s not our fault. So we don’t have to talk about it.
The difference is, Andy, that you’re the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
Might’ve done. And how… do you figure?
Your family’s rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
You know, there’s nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I’m not gonna apologize for my family’s wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society…if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.
We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.
Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I’m trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had.
Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions—
What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy?
You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I’m doing all the heavy lifting. I’m coming up with all the ideas here.
Good. Good. And—[Nellie hits the car against the bushes]
Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
It’s not just today, it’s everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.
Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?
No, I’m serious. There’s always something better.
Like hypothetically… if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
Something cool. Like, sports marketing or… that sound something like you’d be into?
Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you’d have to…
Not even a thought!  It’s not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?
Oh, it’s happening!  Let’s just keep it between you and me for right now.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man!  And Pam’s into it?
We, uh, we haven’t talked about. But I think that she’s—I think she understands… what this is.
Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.
What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!
It’s not real… until your wife is on board.
That is quite an ugly wall, isn’t it?
Needs something, doesn’t it? I’m thinking…a mural.
Yes! You! You are soo talented! It’s going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton’s most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.
Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I—Nellie, this is brilliant!  [sees Jim] Hey!
Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you!
What?! No! I-I got this. [Laughs] Okay?
[quietly] This is his fault. It is not your fault. I’m gonna find you someone better, and rich.
And Filipino. But we’ll break that to her later.
[to Darryl] You know what this is all about.
Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!
Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  [whispers] Yeah.
Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can’t bear to watch this.
I don’t know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
I still can’t believe he didn’t tell me.
I was helping Nellie drive—[Stanley interrupts]
I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith.
Andy Bernard presents: Summer Softball Epic Fails! [Kevin swings bat on screen, fart noise follows] Fail. [repeats] Fail.
A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail! [Points to video] Who’s this guy?
Can’t take the fail? Get out of the fail video!
Hey, I’m Pete, puberty is such a drag, man. And I’m Clark! I like to eat toilet paper. [Clark and Pete wave at camera] We fail! [Video shows memorial of Jerry]
I’d like to take a solemn moment to remember Jerry in the warehouse who passed away this year.
What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK?
Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
Oh that wasn’t…that didn’t work. That was not the right..[Group protests]
[Toby uses tester on wall as Erin marks wall with red tape X] Oh, god.
Nothing! Nothing is going on.  Keep moving please.
OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.
It stands for electromagnetic field.  Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area [Erin marks red tape X on the floor] Especially if they’re poorly insulated. Dwight.
Um, OK I’m just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?
You think I have a machine for measuring bee hives?
I was just asking a question, Toby. How are you not murdered every hour?
Well I’m not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
[mocking] Oh, the wires need insulation. [normal voice] It’s a wire people. I’m not buying it a fur coat.
[Jim rushes to open door for her] Thank you.
Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it won’t take a moment. It’s extremely important and it really has to happen now.
You have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of it’s baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase.
And the…agency require a character reference from my employer.
You wouldn’t have to do anything. I would write the letter myself and you just simply sign it. So.
Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don’t think so.
And I happen to notice you’re down to about thirty seconds here.
And those sand grains are tumbling..
Sure.  I’ll read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. I’ll sign that.
[Reading from computer] “Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!” That means you can’t make me do squat.
You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain’t losing any more good parts.
You people don’t realize what you’re asking. I’d have to rip open the walls.  We’d have to shut this place down for a week.
[Jim puts popcorn bag in microwave] Hey, if you don’t want to teach me Power Point, just say so.
I don’t want to teach you Power Point.
Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
No, dude, I’m not. I’m not the tutorial.
Getting my wife a week off from work.
Well, I don’t know about the rest of you but I’m just gonna say it. I’m nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. [group agrees, protests]
I’m getting older. I’m losing my hair…
[reading from computer] “Side effects of EMF include: headaches…”
No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim.
[scoffs] Yeah right. [Dwight moves mouse pad over his crotch]
Ah! There’s my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot. [notices popped kernels in the bag] What the?
That’s impossible, cause that’s a brand new bag…[looks up to ceiling where there is a red tape X over Dwight’s chair] Oh my god.
I’m gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?
You mean Laverne’s Pies Tires Fixed Also? [Pam nods] Yes we will be doing that. We’ll be getting a dozen.
A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement.
So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour.
[on phone] There are a hundred packs..
[On phone] No six after the eight, no….
Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying]
[handing Nelly envelope] Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.
[laughs] I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don’t know what it was. Not loveable maybe? [laughs] Oh well.
Listen, I’m really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?
Absolutely.  I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
[whispers] Just don’t tell Andy, because..
He hates me and thinks I’m a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness. [Erin nods]
How many times do you need to take a stroll?
I, my legs cramp up! Ok, it’s a circulation issue.
Alright, alright, gang. Let’s just settle down. You’re yelling in her face.
[to Pam] I’m so sorry for all of this.
It’s OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest.
I, I need to get to the paper please. [Reaching for overhead bin above Pam, papers fall and Pam has liquid spilled on her]
I’ll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
You know what? It’s fine, it’s fine. Let me just…it’s fine. [Pam leaves work bus]
Pam, I’m really sorry. I- I’m really sorry about…all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking?
What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you’re locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
It’s not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
You’re the boss. Don’t you think we’d all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
What are you talking about? You’re not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving.
Next stop: Laverne’s Pies Tires Fixed Also.
Oh! Yes! [Group cheers, Dwight moves to driver seat]
[To Dwight] So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
Get your foot behind the yellow line.
Shabooyah, role call. Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah, role call.
Role Call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah, role call!
Role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call!
[Dwight pulls over to pick up hitchhiker] Thanks. Playing a little hookey from work today….Oh my god.
Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve! [group takes pictures] Ah OK, now a serious one.
Hey, where’s Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?
If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
No, I mean he’s sulking. That’s not like him.
He’s just mad that we’re all having fun.
Then why isn’t he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We’re not hostages.
[laughs] Well, I have considered kidnapping one.
I am so excited thinking about this child you’re going to adopt.
I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. I would snap you up.
Let’s go driver! [clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so…
At five? That’s only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
Well, it’s the…carry the four…and…it doesn’t work.
I’m sorry to spoil Jim’s fantastic voyage everyone, but we’re almost out of gas.
OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!
Hey honey, I don’t think we should push him.
Oh no, I’m gonna push him. You know why? Because you’re getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He’s trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won’t get there. Is that what we want?!
That’s impossible. [Dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] Dwight!
Well now I don’t even feel like pie. Wait…no it’s back.
[Dwight’s footsteps sound from the ceiling] Just drive away. Just..
Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour we’re just gonna barely make it.
[to Jim] Go up and check on him. He’s upset.
You know he’s doing all this on purpose.
Please? Just make sure he’s OK? [Jim climbs through hatch]
Hurry it up for god’s sake. They’re gonna be out of banana cream!
Banana cream is the first to go.  We’ll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point! [group gasps]
Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
My trouser hives are void of honey.  I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
That’s genius. That’s the best prank you’ve ever done. [laughs]
It’s inaccurate, dishonest and…in a word? Dongwater.
Ah well, perhaps I could rewrite some of the-
Here’s the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time.  Good luck with your impossible dream.
Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
What position did you use to conceive?
Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn’t you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
[To Pete. Crying sounds come from behind Nelly’s curtain] British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?
Oh, oh no, no. Look, it’s alright. [Erin cries, Nelly comforts her] It really isn’t your fault. No, no. Look, it’s…you were so kind. And it isn’t anything to do with you.
Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we’re all kinda like your children?
You know there’s a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
OK. And they’re all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there’s only one guy who can save them. It’s not me.
Oh! [Jim reenters bus through hatch] Hey! How’d it go?
We bonded. We got to- [Dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of Jim]
When you don’t get out of the way! Out of the way!
Oh, better than OK. [grabs Pam’s shoulders] You know what honey? I’m gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
Everybody! Hang on! [Dwight pulls out quickly]
Oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other]
Pie! Pie! Pie! Pie! [cheers as they arrive]
I changed my mind. [gives Nelly papers]
Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it. [laughs] Well, yeah, whatever. So. [walks away]
[Reading] “She’s tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She’ll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents.”
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Then why don’t you do something about it?
[laughs] Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
You don’t have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! [Oscar pies Kevin] Yes!
[screaming then laughing] It may have been the costliest decision I’ve ever made.
My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but …
I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin…
[as Jim approaches with a knife] Jim, no. No. No! No!
But as Jim and I discovered…  No! … any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
Cece’s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
I’m an oncologist and you are a dog.
No, I’m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.
Uh, Jim, you’re not dressed up at all.
Sure I am. I am… one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?
Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.
So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?
There’s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
Gettin’ a lot of mileage out of this, aren’t ya?
A jitterbug. [giggles] You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions?
The senator will be joining us later.
Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
What lab did these little clones escape from?
Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.
Ugh. I don’t want to sit through a whole concert of that.
Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
No. Nope. Nope nope nope. Stay away.
You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael’s Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I’m so not prepared.
Are you sure you’re okay with me putting in this much money.
Yeah. I mean, listen if we’re gonna do this thing, we should do it right.
Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I’m eating Jims.
[laughing] Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
[laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Oh no, I’m spilling Jim all over the carpet. [laughing]
[picking up spilled candy] Hello little pill. What do you do?
Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation: There’s a madman in our midst.
This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it’s not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It’s not for any disorder of the body. [whispering] It’s for a disorder of the mind.
Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane… [whispering] They are now off their meds.
Dwight, our co-workers’ health issues are really none of our business so-
Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What’s going on Nellie? Talk to me.
It’s my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I’m not ashamed of that, But I’m not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong.
Yeah, you’re right. This man needs to be apprehended.
You didn’t come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, now’s your chance! I’m here. You got Qs; I got As.
No, I don’t have AIDS. That’s not what I said. Next question.
You don’t have any– Any questions about the old days? [clears throat] You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ?
I thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ.
I just thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ.
Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.
I didn’t realize that everybody here dresses up every year.
It’s Halloween. That is really, really good timing.
I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that you’re Boner Champ.
[on computer monitor] I’m so sorry! I don’t know how that could have happened.
I just– I just started yappin’ about the old days, and I guess the wine coolers were flowing, and, you know, somehow things just got hinky.
Could you just call them and tell them the truth? ‘Cause I know it’s really stupid, but it’s also really, really, really important.
And the graphic designer is going to be sending in some of the logo treatments. I can’t wait to see them.
I’ve also been running the numbers and between our backers and our own investments, we’re looking great for a full year on this.
Oh Jim, I explained everything. So you’re all set.
Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we’d really like to uh you know, invest – get in on the ground floor.
Wow, well what level of investment were you thinking about?
We were thinking somewhere between five – ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just – [blows air] – all in.
Hi Daryl. I’m just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.
That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound… crazy?
I can’t really picture it. Can you… get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.
[whispering] I don’t know. I just don’t know.
Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories?
Yeah, I got a call from Broccoli Rob. I guess you really are the Boner Champ.
Spring sing ‘95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way.
And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway… Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?
Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!
You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!
I, uh, huh, just [chuckles nervously]
All having this wonderful Halloween gathering. Excuse me, is that punch?
They didn’t know about the snowman story, and when I told ‘em, they were not impressed.
Hey! You better do ‘Faith.’ You get me?
So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you’re like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin’ song.
Look, I know it was big with the old guys, but–
Buts… are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out… And make it a surprise, please. [to Pete] This isn’t stupid.
Yes. I thought I’d you know, be you.
[laughing] It’s funny right? [Toby starts to lean in for a kiss, then runs away]
All right. All right, just …stay focused on the pill.
Okay, look Dwight, let’s just call this thing off. I mean, it’s just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.
Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!
Gotcha! Yeah! Let’s see ya get out of this web, huh?
Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? It’s for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too.
Oh man, it was great. They were great.
Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about… ten…
Yeah. Yeah. It’s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to…
Did everybody end up investing ten thousand?
They weren’t really talking that much about money. They just said, We’re good with investing and then I…and I…
Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had…we should talk about it later.
Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where’s the band? ‘Cause there’s just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths.
Now folks, by special request, we’re going to take it a little old school. There is a former Trebler in this room.
No. Do not sing that. Do not… Oh man…
He reminded us today of how much he means to us. And we certainly seem to mean a lot to him, so without any further ado, here’s an old Treble classic.
[on flat screen tv] [singing lead of Faith]
Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here?
She said you wanted to hear ‘Faith’. That’s Broccoli Rob’s signature song.
I really didn’t know that man. I just thought you wanted to hear it.
Russell, I’m dressed like George Michael.
The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it’s kind of pathetic. But when you’re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.
Champ, I feel awful about this whole thing. Russell called me up. And they said they needed 20 cc’s of George Michael stat. So just… Wham! I sprang into action. You know me. I assumed you wanted to hear me do your signature number.
You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man’s signature solo is his for life, okay? That’s group policy and you know it.
Look, it’s not my fault that I still live near campus, and it’s my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys., and stop in two, three times a week.
I tell you what, we’ll have a sing-off for it. You pick twelve alums from any year to back you up and I’ll do the same, and I’m so confident that I’ll win, I won’t even warm up.
My pipes are primo, Champ. Why don’t you ask Trey Anastasio about my pipes?
I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!
He said, and I quote, ‘Hey Rob, nice pipes’. That happened!
OK, fine, yeah. that’s one guy’s opinion!
That’s real.  ‘That’ll never change!
Doesn’t mean you’re the best singer ever. Dick.
I thought that concert was pretty great.
Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
They lost me when they sang ‘Monster Mash’. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
Angela, it’s Halloween. You have to sing ‘Monster Mash’.
Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?
No I’m just, I’m saying, what would happen if they didn’t sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?
No! No, I’m interested. I mean I think everybody’s interested in why they have to sing it.
Because it is Halloween. So if you’re going to sing a concert, it’s a good idea to throw that one in.
Yeah, yeah, no, no. It’s a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can’t do if you just keep singing ‘Monster Mash.’
It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ‘Monster Mash.’ I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!
This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell?
I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?
Oh well, Andy, we’re not moving to Cornell.
It could totally work though. I don’t know why we wouldn’t. Oh my god are we doing this?
If I am not Boner Champ, I don’t know who I am.
Well, um, you know maybe you’re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just–
Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.
[whispering] I want some of those pills.
Oh, well good for you. I mean, you’ll need a prescription.
Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They’re not for me. They’re for my cousin Mose. He’s just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.
Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he’s a good man and that I hope he feels better.
[on phone] Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there. [pause] What?
Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay?
White, I’m not a day trader, I’m just a first responder in a disaster.
Andy’s family had a total meltdown.  His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he’s been handling it is just..so..
Kevin, listen to me. I’m in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
That’s beautiful. No, I totally get that.
I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.
I don’t know what that means. Hey, hey-
[On phone] Oh, great! Yeah, um, I’ll get right back to you. [hangs up] Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?
Nope, that’s Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand]
Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he’s on a downward spiral with booze.
Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour.
[wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle…[Group protests]
…In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason.
[walking away] Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit….
Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So…what else we got? Non-boat ideas. [Oscar looks outside conference room at Kevin and Angela at the copier]
Jammed. This day couldn’t get worse. [Kevin laughs]
Yeah, I think this day could get worse.
[to Angela] I don’t know what you’re talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar]
She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
Alright, what’s the grand total? Did we make our nut?
If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.
Guys, you don’t understand, this boat’s been in our family since before I was born.
Don’t you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
See? I bet you wouldn’t sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
I would if I owned it and I went broke.
Alright, uh…alright. I’m gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat.
Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don’t need the boat. Can’t cry about it.  What are you gonna do? Cry about it? [chokes up] Excuse me.
[On phone] Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called.  The interview’s off. They’re opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so…
Well why don’t I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple.
Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn’t how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it’s a girlfriend’s job to know her man and I know Andy. [laughs] He’s seriously juvenile.
Oh no, he couldn’t be more than late thirty’s. Tops.
Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds- [phone rings in break room, Dwight picks up] This is Dwight Shrute.
[on other end in conference room] Please hold for Ms. Black.
[Darryl plays radio show music on keyboard] And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I’m Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin’s senior sales associate Dwight Shrute.
Iris, thank you so much for having me.
[muffled by watermelon teeth] Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth. [laughs]
Oh, I just need your signature on this.
Kevin, we’re out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?
I don’t know why I’m surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
[laughing in Oscar’s direction] Oh really, Angela? That’s interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! [Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom!
That actually wasn’t the worst cover. I’d say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.
I have to go to the bathroom! [runs out]
[running from elevator] I have to go to the bathroom!
[Drives away waving, then screeches to a stop and runs from car]
Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?
Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert…perfect.
Well, when does the boat leave, exactly?
Then screw lunch. Let’s go for a sunset sail.
Yeah right. It’s in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now.
Ok, well then let’s leave like right now.
Of course, seriously. Get your coat on.
[On speakerphone] Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he’s not hands on.
[As Iris] So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command?
Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris.
Uh, excuse me. [reading card held up by Jim] I’m being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons?
[Jim mimes taking shirt off] I’m so sorry we’re going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together.
[Takes shirt off] Now then, we were saying.  When my workers-gather-
Oh, I’m so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. [Jim holds up card that says “Now Pants”] Your voice, it’s sounding a little feminine.
Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper?
The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
That man he’s up against is so dirty. And the senator’s just pushing back as hard as he can.
Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. [Kevin laughs]
[Getting up to leave] I can’t, it’s too much! [laughing]
I’m getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?
[holding hand over phone] This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They’re not gonna gotch me.
[looking at folder he brought Toby]It’s clearly not an accounting mistake.
Kevin.  His gambling problem must’ve resurfaced. I’m gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation.
Well, you’ve gotta do what you’ve gotta do.
This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! [Pam tells Jim to leave the conference room] I dare you to produce one credible source about this.
Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc…Sandra Mick [points to Pam]
[changing voice] Good afternoon Iris, it’s a pleasure.
Let’s get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic?
Unless it’s exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled! [Jim runs panicked into break room]
What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?
[on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I’m getting a promotion?
Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn’t screw up your secret with Angela. I’ve been really worried about that.
Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you about-
Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..
Oscar, we’re in the middle of talking.
Oh, you’re right I’m so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money]
Oh that is nice. Classy move. [leaves]
[yelling in break room] That’s what I’m saying! No of course not!
Those figures I gave you? They’re false.
I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.
I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible.
What are you talking about? I just did this now.
A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler..
I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict.
Tough? I put an innocent man on death row.
My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!
I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it’s beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
Trying to rig a boat here.  I don’t know how to do that when you’re standing in the way.
I’m not a ghost, so I can’t walk through people.
Geez, a little bit. [to boat] How you doing old buddy? Missed you.
It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing.
Oh, it’s OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me.
You got it. You know what then, we’ll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor. [begins raising sail, boat guy slaps his hand]
We’ve already started boarding. And no one is insured to rig her up right now except us.
You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just- [Raises sail, guys slaps hand again] wow.
I can smack you all day if you keep touching what you’re not supposed to touch.
Good stuff. Nice stuff. [begins raising sail again when guy leaves, but he comes back and smacks Andy’s hand again] [bleep] Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.
Well, we’re doing it. We’re finally having a picnic on the boat.
I’ve had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.
Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.
As long as we’re on this boat, as far as I’m concerned, you’re the captain.
I’m the captain. [to boat guy] Hey, charm school.
I hate to uh, ruin this moment…or breakdown, but you already signed the papers. So, if you want your boat back, you can pick it up there in the Bahamas in 10 days.
Yeah, I know cause I’m sailing it there.
OK, no. I already said, you’re not getting back your deposit.
Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?
[using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm]
Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin’ at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I’ve got a solution. I know Wallace’s phone number, everyone hold, I’ll conference him in.
Oh, Mr. Shrute, there’s really no need to, um involve Mr… Wallace.
Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to…I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello.  [Opens door, Andy’s brother is passed out inside] Walt?
Oh god, thank goodness you’re here. I was having a little trouble with this door. Yesterday. I um, I think it was yesterday.
Yeah, uh, I just, I figured I’d get that first relapse out of the way. God, what’s happened to our family? Everything is so messed up! How did you even know I was in here?
I didn’t.  I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat.  But I’ve decided to sail it to Bermuda.
Same thing. [To Walt] Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on.
Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?
Oh, I’m OK.  I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David.
You’re welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I’m gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?
…with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you’re away in prison.
Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go.
[enters main office, group claps] Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?
Shrute! Shrute! Shrute!Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute!
Overall, I’d say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected.
Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.
Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters]
I just had a little intuition that someone I loved needed a little bit of attention today. Oscar, you’re looking very healthy. Getting lots of vigorous exercise? [touches Oscar’s shoulder. Oscar jumps away quickly]
Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
What was that? I’m sorry, I didn’t mean any offense. I was just trying to be friendly.
You know what? I’m sorry. I overreacted. Because I’m stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who’s not stressed out? Who’s not stressed out? Who-
Come on Oscar, we’re not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support. [claps, group joins]
I have to say I’m impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.
I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. [laughs] Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn’t even know. [laughing still] Her life is a complete sham!
Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you.  Do you realize that? You’re the best ever!
[Standing on dock] Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend.
[pulling away from dock] Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World’s Greatest. You did this! Dammit I’m happy!
Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he’d asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.
[waving from boat] I’ll see you in three weeks!
Hey bro! It was here all along. [holding guitar]
Erin I gotta go![Walt begins playing] Them’s my chords!
Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard’s for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can’t promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper.
Oh. Nope. It’s not that, he uh, uh he flipped a table one time when he was drunk.
No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes.  They’re like two flaming meatballs in my skull.
Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family’s boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song — No, woman. No cry.
[on computer] Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That’s what I call the sun now.
Andy, it’s Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!
Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
Yeah, it was. That’s okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out.  Ow!
Ah! That’s not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know? [laughs crazily]
[on computer] I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.
No. No! Nooo! [computer falls into ocean]
[answering phone] Dwight Schrute. [turns on speakerphone] Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
[on speakerphone] Well, I have some very exciting news.
And you didn’t call Jim – that seems significant.
Jim, good! You should hear this too.
[taking away Dwight’s handset] Go ahead David, I’m listening.
Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but… I don’t know where I’d put you.
Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They’ve apparently just dropped the supplier they’ve been with for the last ten years. .
Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you.
I’m gonna need to put you on hold for a second. [presses hold button] Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat… where’s Stanley?
Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
Yeah! Okay. [presses button again] Hey David, I’m back.
So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?
No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. It’s someone new but she didn’t catch her name.
Shhh! [clears throat] Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
Good luck to you. [disconnects call]
Dwight, you can’t go. You have a problem with women. You can’t sell to them.
That is a damnable lie. I love women.
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ‘gy-na’ for your entire meeting.
Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
Guys, we can’t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses… Pizza Friday could come back.
Hey remember that week in the 90’s when we got bagels?
I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I’m helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I’ve ever been excited about work. So, that feels… wrong.
Okay, call down. It’s just me, not Tom Selleck.
Toby got us all to participate in Movember. It’s a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November.
So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time.
Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh?
I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex.
[to passing female pedestrian] Smile if you love men’s prostates.
[whispering] I think the senator is having an affair.
[dropping desk drawer] This doesn’t… I’m sorry. Wha… what?
I think the senator is having an affair.
I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela’s husband spoon me back to bed.
When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
And he’s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class – it’s Hot Yoga with Blake.
Angela, Blake’s also a guy’s name so he… may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
I just never heard about the senator and yoga…
From you. I’m sure it’s probably nothing. But what’s with the yoga already?
And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
So, uh, show us how you’d normally sell to a female client.
Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
I am? Hmm..  [deep voice] Hi, I’m Mr. Hannon.  How can I help you?
Okay, this isn’t working for me, ‘cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
He’s absolutely right. I’m really struggling.
Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.
I never sit down during sales  meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I’m finished, it’s over.
Okay, let’s stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?
I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me?
Uh,, well you’re the only one ‘on’ – we’re all here.
[nervous laughter] Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months…
That’s the winter season., three months.
[hushed voice] Uh yeah. Trust me, I’d rather be with you guys.
[laughing] Uh, yeah, that sounded kinda spooky-sexy, over here Halpert.
Oh, [clearing throat, deeper voice] Sorry, I uh… was just saying that we should uh…
Whoa. [laughing] I think there’s been a bit of a mistake. We’re trying to reach Jim Halpert, not Batman.
[laughing]  Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had… I should have just had you call me on my cell.
I’m gonna try a different spot. Okay?
Okay, when you’re selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their… Are you listening now?
That’s impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don’t vibrate at all.
A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
Nellie, why don’t you  tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you’re listening.
It’s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
And then we thought we’d … I can’t. I just can’t  carry on with that face. Look at it. I’m gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he’s laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.
He’s screwed. They’re meeting in less than an hour.
Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It’s all garbage okay? You’re the woman, I’m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
Okay, I’m a woman. [high voice] I’m a woman. Good?
Oh, are those your kids? They’re so cute! They could be models.
Thank you. I’m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.
Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It’s hopeless.
Ten years ago, I didn’t care if Dwight  got married or died a beet-farming bachelor.  But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I’m like, that poor gimp is somebody’s child.
You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.
Look, I have no problem with women. It’s businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don’t lie about your shoulders!
Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?
I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
Okay, so, when you’re selling to this woman, just imagine that she’s that nice, reasonable barber.
Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?
Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
[whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
Oh my God! She’s so stunningly tiny!  She’s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they’re doing.
She’s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
[gasps] I’ve heard of this – dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail – ew. I’d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let’s go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun.
What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in —
[on phone] It was in what? Jim, we’re having a lot of trouble hearing you.
The… the… the… what I was saying is the real genius was…[car alarm blaring] was in the…
It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so …
[on phone]  Jordan wore them for nobody? We’re not following you, Halpert.
Have a seat. Um, she will be right in.
Oh, great. Oh, I’m sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don’t have it.
[to himself] Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.
You son of a bitch. You’re firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?
Forget everything we taught you.  Hey, Jan! It’s so great to see you.
I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off. [laughs]
Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.
I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace  after all these years.  Oh, well. What are you doing?
So this was all just a trick. You don’t really have any business to give?
You did good, Dwight. It’s okay. I mean, seriously, Jan’s not normal. Let’s just go. She’s not going to sell to us.
Yes, she is. Now,  I may not have any instincts with women, but I have  an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I’ll be right back.
Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?
Fine. I will show you one… slide show.
I know. That’s great. It just – it makes it look like there’s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
A handsome eyebrow, but, um… it makes your mouth look like an eye socket… which isn’t bad.
But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye… fell out… Which is great. It’s such a great cause.
Mommy, you’re a princess. Mommy, you’re a superstar. Mommy you’re the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?
Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
And it is so cute how she signs her name.
[chuckles] Well, that — that was — that was me too.
Oh, okay. It’s just that’s how Cece does it with the backwards ‘E’s.
Well, it’s not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, “Cece” is two letters and “Astrid” is… I mean, there’s even some adults who — who — who can’t spell it.
Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.
[whispering] I’m so sorry. I hate this. You’re better.
[whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let’s go.
[stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs]
Wait. Why are you… Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can’t get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire —
[whispering] Please. It’s Robert who’s enjoying it.
This could be the affair that you’re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. [pause] But uh, he’s probably not gay. He’s straight. He’s straight, so…
Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
Jan… You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I’ve got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
I don’t recall. And yes, Molly is crap.
Do what? Get into sales? That’s what I want.
He’s been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do… So young.
Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
[to Clark] Do you have a valid passport?
It’s just… it’s not totally working.
Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing — not ideal. But don’t worry. I’ll figure it out.
Yeah, well, it’s not just not ideal. I mean, with you there, I don’t know how we’re gonna do this.
Uh, what does — what does that mean?
Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
I don’t know, Angela. I’m dehydrated. Maybe… You heard me wrong. We should just go.
Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
[ducking under table with Oscar] Oh. Oh.
Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.
Oh and uh, Molly… I know it can’t be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
That’s all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
Because you are my friend and you are a woman… And women love gossip. It’s like air to you people. Ugh, God. [retching]
Oscar… [sighs] can I ask you a question?
[whispering] Of course, ask me a que–  questions.
[hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.
I think the thermostat is acting up again.
It’s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I’m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I’ll just go downstairs.
She doesn’t know. I shouldn’t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
Well, well, well, it’s finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.
These are my painting clothes.I think I’m gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. [Jim applauds]
Sure you don’t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.
You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
Last week Jim wasn’t there, and they named the company Athlead.
I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
[sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who’s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
I think it’s good. He likes fishing.
Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.
Dwight, it’s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.
I know. That’s not why I’m naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks]
Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
Oh, I’m sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I’m not in your panties, I don’t go vigilantes. Why don’t you ask your husband?
My marriage is in danger. I don’t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
[sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?
Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.
[phone vibrates] Oh, look at that. Yeah, he’s free anytime. Not a problem.
I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
[on phone] Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there’s a crisis — the more I think about it —
Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I’m gone.
Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes– Maybe this can work.
I don’t know, because we’re not friends.
How about this– You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands]
Well, I’ve gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher.
You’re not getting this, Peter.  Make it go wider… up!
Cool. It should be taller though, right?
Obviously. He’s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he’s not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don’t see them so I think we’re good.
I started following people around to get exercise. Turns out, I’m damn good at it.
[snickers] Does he own a gun? Show her.
Read the receipt. That’s a $300 gun. Someone could steal it.
Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor’s had stolen from him?
Oh, you tell me. [shows Dwight receipt]
[studying mural wall] I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It’s just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I’m gonna limit myself to one shrub.
Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that…
It’s probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote ‘sausage factory.’
All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed.
You get half now and half upon completion of said job.
Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
Okay, that’s the big one. That’s the big “M.”
Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I’ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch–
That’s very effective. I’ve been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. It’s devastating.
No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.
I’m trying, but what you’re asking is–
It’s the only thing that will make this right.
Okay. But it’s cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can’t scrub worth a damn.
All right, then it’s settled. One knee-capping. Now, the hit goes down at 4:00. Keep in mind, once I leave, there’s no turning back.
You know, truth be told, I think all you’ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I’m gone.
We’ve got all afternoon to talk about that.
I’ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
Actually, the surf and turf does come with lob–
Oh, thanks, Oscar. You’re such an angel.
[talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so… yeah, we’re good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah– Well, I gotta go now, but– Okay, bye. Bye.
Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex.
Well, yeah, what can I say, a player’s gotta play.
Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I’m gonna let them think the other thing.
Oh, be careful! Be careful! Be careful
No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.
[shouting as tower collapses] Oh no! Kevin!
What did I just say? What did I just say?
There we go. All right, let’s do it.
You know, at the end of the day, it’s really only two days. I mean, I’ll be back in the office.  If you need me for an emergency, call me.  I’ll be there…
You know what? I don’t know where the years went.  ‘Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don’t even recognize them.
Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I don’t know.
All right. You know what?  Maybe we’ll just… We’ll go slow.
No. Jim… [wine bottle clangs on plate]
Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh!
Nice.  Pretty soon, we’re gonna be at the ceiling.
Oh, come on. We could use a blank card.
You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn’t fart on a butterfly.
No, I wouldn’t. I can’t even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I’d like to try.
Hmm. Yeah.  All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam…
The target– it’s Oscar, isn’t it? He and the senator are gaying each other.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you’re engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.
Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger’s knees whacked. But a co-worker– Dare I say, a friend?
Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
I can’t even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
Well, you might be right. But it’s too late now.
Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.
There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They’re extraordinary.
Sandwich delivery for Mr. Oscar Martinez.
No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside.
You know, there’s doughnuts in the break room.
Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that’s– that’s decorative.
Don’t– don’t– don’t pole people with knives.
[groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha!
There’s no time to explain. [descending stairs] Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.
What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who’s the father of her child?
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Oh, don’t lie. I’m trying to save those precious knees you’re always bragging about.  Now, let’s get out of here. He could be right behind us.
Aah! Actually, he’s right in front of us.
Let’s get it on. I’m gonna do this. I might– I might puke, but I’m gonna do this.
No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He’s a Dunder-Mifflin man. He’s my tribe.
I’m sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, I’m gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues– Stop! No!
Don’t move. And disarm now! [Oscar gets weapon away from others]
No! No, Oscar. He’s a friend. He’s a friend.
Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They’re family-owned, but don’t let that take away from your edge!
Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you.
Remember, you’re a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this.
[into phone] Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I’m calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say… your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, “Hey, kool-aid.” Yeah, your mama’s fat. This is Pam Halpert.
Basically I couldn’t tell, but I think…
I– I thought they were confused at least…
Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. [hangs up] Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!
If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend.
I just saved your life. You’re welcome!
You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
You deserved every bit of it!  You made my husband gay.
What– what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is… gay. He was gay when you married him!
Angela, until you face that, you’re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead — I won’t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert…
For insulting a client’s recently deceased mother.
Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.
[cheers and applause as Pete puts last card on tower]
I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
[crying] Jazz is stupid!  I mean, just play the right notes!
I know. You’re gonna be okay, Monkey.
I don’t like him either.  And yet I really like him.
Well, we’re here. Perfect.  [covers sleeping Phyllis with his jacket]
Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or–
[laughing] I did enjoy grinding your beans, son.
[laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.
This is hilarious, but we’re gonna stop with all–
Shuckin’ the peas.  You should go back to the first part, though. You are  gonna  cover for me?
Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
Oh, my God, thank you. [hugging both] Thank you.
If you’re an artist, you have to be okay with the idea  that you can’t please everybody all the time.
Shut up, Hide!  I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him– or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I’m okay with that.
Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
Well, he didn’t fight me hard on it.
I– I don’t know if there’s truth to– to, uh, to that.
What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person’s penis?
Well, yeah, but I’m wondering if it’s too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I’d get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don’t care about Jim’s new sports job in Phila-Whatever.
So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don’t know the end of the word “Philadelphia”?
Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning “Love,” and adelph, meaning “Adolf.” “the city that loves Adolf.” Good luck with your new enterprise and don’t wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
Oh…Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!
I mean, it says “X-Mas party,” but I think we all know what that’s code for.
So we’re not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
Oh, right, like I’m responsible ’cause I’m in charge of the party planning committee.
Well, you are the one in charge of it.
Don’t blame me for something we all forgot.
Yeah, let’s not blame her for something we all forgot.
I didn’t realize how many of Angela’s opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn’t. Hmm, funny how that works.
[Scoffs] We’re out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin’ our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!
Well, then, why don’t we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?
Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?
What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas’ rural German companion, Belsnickel.
Yes! That, that, that! We’re definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa–What’s so hard to understand?
Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.
I’m not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
[Blows a weak whistle] Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
I’m just hoping German terrorists don’t take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.
Wait, German terrorists? That’s oddly specific. And I think–I think you mean John McCain.
Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.
“now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.”
“Come out to the coast, we’ll get together, have a few laughs.”
Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he’s like, “Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother–”
Actually, he doesn’t say that there. He says it earlier when he’s on the radio with Hans.
Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen]
[Points and Pete] Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it.
[In Kitchen] We’re thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
[Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim’s shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
Yeah, Jim’s going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven’t heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?
What else could you possibly be forgetting?
You know who’s not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he’s in prison [Jim and Daryl walk out of the kitchen] for something he may not have done.
I’m sorry, the–Uh, the Scranton who?
The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven’t I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago?
[Gasps] Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can’t, I mean, I understand.
[Pats Nellie on the shoulder as he’s walking by her] See you next Christmas.
I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back.
No. I don’t want my name attached to this party.
What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
Please just take my name off of everything.
Just take her name off of everything.
[Clears her throat] The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we’re all going to do Dwight’s Christmas.
Yes! Yeah! [High Fives Jim] Yeah! Okay! Yes! It’s a Christmas Miracle! [High Fives Pam] Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.
[Plays a trumpet] And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
What is it? [Jim lifts the hog maw with a fork] Don’t touch it.
[Comes running up at startles Pam] Somebody’s found the hog maw.
What? It’s a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That’s a beauty, isn’t it? I don’t even want to tell you what it’s made of until after you try it.
It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.
Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where’s the karaoke machine?
Have you ever tasted a Shepherd’s Crook?
I don’t know. Is it what you expected?
I feel like [Pam look’s out the window and camera pans out in The Office]–Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
[Speaking German] Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. [Blows out the candle] Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.
“Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that–”
[On a computer, checking the script] Eh. That wasn’t the line. I’m sorry, Pete.
That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes.
I don’t know. This looks pretty legit. [Erin’s cell phone chimes] Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.
Right, um, okay. So he says, uh, [Pete stands up] “After we call the police, they’ll waste hours trying to negotiate–”
We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
Or we can just sit and talk, though.
No. No more talking. It’s movie time.
I mean, are you sure…Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car.
Oh, great. Great! So we’re watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.
[To Nellie in the kitchen] Here’s the thing about moonlight. It’s not sunlight.
[With his mouth full] I love this hog mama.
[Chokes and spits it out] What is maw?!
[Cackling] Ohh…[In a German Accent] Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!
Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was…okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.
Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! [Runs over to Stanley and points at his stomach with a stick] Ohh…Too much strudel.
So he’s kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
No, much better–No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.
Wow! It’s my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
Come on, Dwight, you’re making this up.
[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. “Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.”
Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight’s traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
[Continues reading] “His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface.”
Oh, come on. We don’t blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys. [Texts warehouse worker, Nate, to forget showing up as zwarte piet]
Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn’t that crazy?
[Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy…what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It’s awful.
No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They’re a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.
Quick question–Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
But more than once? ’cause you could have made a mistake.
Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you’re gonna find out who’s–
Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as…admirable. [Jim claps] There you are.
[Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these?
It’s a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
You can’t have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year [looks over at Angela, then back to Oscar]…as impish! [Smacks Oscar with a stick]
No, I’m carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder [puts a mouse trap in Pam’s bowl]
[Holds the mouse trap up] Mouse trap.
It’s a punishment. [Turns to Jim] Hey, where are you going?
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
Yeah, I know, I’d just like to settle in and get a good night’s sleep.
But we were gonna break the pig rib.
No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this–off with you!
Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don’t you want to know your present?
Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! [Jim holds his hands like a bowl] I judge your year as impish. [Hits Jim with stick]
[Hits Jim three more times] I judge you impish!
Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn’t hit anybody that hard.
They’re not abandoning the party. [Hit’s Jim again]
[As he’s walking out] That’s enough, I’m done! Okay? Agh!
[Hits Jim some more] Impish! [Chases Jim out]
Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in]
[In the parking lot, holding his side, walking to the taxi, Pam follows] Oh…what was that? Now I’m gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. [To taxi driver] One second. Oh…
I’m probably never gonna see you again.
I can’t believe this is actually happening.
Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
Okay. [Jim and Pam hug] Good luck. You’re gonna be great.
Party’s over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. [To camera] And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn’t real. It’s me, Dwight! [Takes off hat and beard]
Oh, it sounds like the party’s starting up out there.
Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting.
Meredith’s a little cute. I’m just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.
For what it’s worth, I liked your party better.
Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.
Jim couldn’t even stay till the end of the party.
Well, that didn’t have anything to do with you.
I don’t care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.
I’m gonna tell Jim to go [Bleep] himself.
Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
Yeah. Definitely. [Erin starts to cry] Hey, what’s–Oh, no, come here. [Starts to put his arm around Erin] Hey, hey. Come on, huh?
[Sliding away from Pete] I’m still Andy’s girlfriend.
Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?
No, thanks. I’ll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.
[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.
What’s going on? Where’s the belsnickel?
What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.
[Holds his finger to Jim’s lips] Shh. Let’s not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I’m gonna dig it out of the trash! [High fives Jim]
What happened? Did you miss your bus?
No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss]
[Comes back in, holding up the pig rib] I found it!
And I found out that there’s a bus at 5:00 a.m.
Oh! [Pig rib breaks and Jim wins, and stuff splatters people. Everyone groans] Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.
[To himself] Back for more, huh? [Gets up and walks towards Jim]
Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where’s Andy?
Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They’re gonna bring you in for an interview.
[Looking at Jim confused] That’s great.
I shall come by at your convenience.
Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]
[Claps his hands once, spins around] Whoo!
[Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa!
Two dimes, seven nickels–Well, okay, no, that doesn’t add up. It was one quarter and–
Shh. [Puts her finger to Toby’s lips]
[Put her finger to his lips again] Shh.
Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don’t even-… [Jim bites his lip]
Sucks. Anyway, I just don’t see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough.
Oh, the Nets are super tough.  [Jim in pain from his lip]
Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
The Hawks are terrible. They’re always terrible.
Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the… [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]
Whatever. It’s not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that’s gonna happen…[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That’s it, I’m going home!
[talking on phone] You sound tired. Everything ok?
Great. Everything’s great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
Uhh, a little bit. It’s a lot of pressure, you know, but that’s what I signed up for right?
Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
Alright. I mean, it’s what you want, so…
I’ll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.
Me neither. Come here. [she hugs Darryl, and Darryl smiles behind her back]
Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.
Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.
He didn’t leave me. He just went part time. [Meredith scratches her head vigorously] Can you just fill out the form please?
I’m sure she’s just confused. People scratch their heads when they’re confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens.
[checking Meredith’s head]  Trust me, I know what I’m doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.
Holy wow, that’s a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!
Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
Dwight, relax. It’s just lice. Maybe, possibly.
Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I’ve ever seen. You are all clear.
Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning. [Dwight starts spraying everyone with disinfectant]
[getting her head checked] Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.
Alright, let’s give her a break. We don’t know for sure this is Meredith’s fault.
Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody’s taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen.
Lice. More lice. [Angela shrieks in disgust] Angela has lice.
[checking Stanley’s head] Ooh yabber, lice!
[checking Oscar’s head] Oh yeah, big time lice.
I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
Alright, we’re going down to my warehouse, that means we’re playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.
Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard’s pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink.
Here man. [Kevin hands Daryll some chocolate] You need that more than me.
Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.
Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.
That’s it. I’m getting my stuff. I’m leaving for the day.
No! Stanley! If you leave now then you’ll get it in your car and then you’ll get it in your house! [Erin jumps on Stanley’s back]
I’m trying to save you from yourself!
Alright, I’ll stay! There’s a pencil broken in my rolls.
Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let’s not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I’ll tell her it was me.
Oh man, that’s fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?
Oh no, no, no. That’s ok. [Jim shoves some snacks in his pocket as he gets out of limo] Um I’m sorry, is this the conference center?
No, Mr. Irving called. Said he’d rather meet you at his private court.
Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something.
[shaving her own head] Yes, Pam what do you want?
Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?
Baking a cake, what does it look like I’m doing? Getting rid of the lice.
Oh, can you hold that thought? That’s my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?
I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time.  I will buy her a wig, we’ll have a few laughs. There’s a right way to do this.
Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it’s kill or be killed!
No, no. It’s more of a nuisance really. It’s not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats…
She’s right, it works. I would imagine.
Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it’s a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.
I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
[walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!?
Take a picture. It will last longer.
We don’t want it to last longer. It’s horrible.
Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I’m the only one with the balls to show them lice who’s boss.
No, no, it’s not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I’m at the store, candy, or…or one of those stylish turbans?
Thanks Pam! I’ll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.
Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn’t look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other.
What’s gonna make you feel better, big guy?
When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn’t feeling good. She’s not around to do that anymore. I’m sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.
Aw, poor Darryl. I can’t bear to see him suffer like this.
I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.
Mmm, this won’t help him, it’s a muffin, not cake.
Listen, let’s try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most.
I hope you don’t mind me bringing you out here. I can’t get my knees under a desk.
Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
Well, do you think you can sink one from deep?
Listen, I don’t mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
Okay. [Jim shoots the basket and it goes in] Wow, Halpert’s got game.
Alright. [Jim’s phone rings] Oh, sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s my wife, can I take this?
Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what’s up? Everything ok?
Oh, no everything’s great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.
It’s still happening right now actually, so uh…
He’s really making you work for it, huh?
Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything’s okay?
Great. I am killing it over here. [drops mayonnaise on the ground] Jim, I gotta go.
Okay, bye. [Jim turns back to Julius] So sorry about that.
No problem. Hey Jim, what size do you wear, man? I got a pair of japanese Nikes with your name on them. What do you think?
[handing out mayonnaise jars] Once it’s all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
Oh sure, and when you’re ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right. [Dwight holds up a pair of scissors]
Put those away before you hurt yourself.
[swings the scissors around and puts them into his pocket, putting a hole in his Hazmat suit] Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!
Okay, it’s easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.
Oscar, do you want to be my partner?
Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay?
Oh, Creed, I’m so sorry. I’m…I’m already partners with Pete, right Pete?
Uh, yeah. We promised each other if we ever got lice, we’d buddy up. Sorry, man.
[Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar’s head] Angela.
You don’t want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
[putting mayo on Stanley’s head] You’re getting a bargain. I ain’t got no hair no more.
[putting mayo on Creed’s head] Creed, I’m all done. My turn.
I’m sorry, Pam. It looks a little messy.
[putting mayo on Erin’s head] How’s that?
I feel it working. [Erin and Pete playing around with the mayo] Eiffel tower!
Well, we don’t want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.
We think you made a big, big mistake.
He’s a real catch and you should take him back.
Thank you all for your concern, but I’m gonna have to ask you to leave, okay?
So does this mean you’re gonna take Darryl back?
Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? ‘Cause I’m free, literally forever.
Yeah, Kevin asked me out. I was kinda feeling good about reentering the dating pool, but then Kevin asked me out. Thought I might trade up to a new level of man. Then Kevin asked me out.
[on speaker phone] Hi, honey, it’s mom. Look, Cece’s school just called. She still has lice.
Now, don’t worry, don’t worry. I’m on my way to pick her up, but you might have lice too. You know, lice can be tricky. Sometimes lice, like…[Pam hangs up phone]
[everyone yelling at Pam]You guys, I am so sorry! It’s just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that…
Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.
[talking through the loud speaker] She’s right Pam.
Is there a volume knob on that thing?
Yeah there’s a volume knob on that thing.
Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She’s a monster.
I meant to say something earlier. I just…
Who’s the one who didn’t bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn’t bring the lice in. That was all Pam.
Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don’t think it’s kicked in yet. I’m gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. [Dwight collapses]
[Angela rinsing Oscar’s hair, and she bumps his head] Ow!
[shoving large amounts of bubble wrap into the baler, as a warehouse worker passes]  No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.
Yeah, I’m kinda sad to see this baby go.
You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
Okay. Okay. [rinsing Pete’s hair out] Is that too cold?
I wonder what happened over there. I’ve been sitting here the whole time. [as the baler crushes the bubble wrap, making loud noises]
Let’s give it a shot. Let’s make it work.
Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just…I don’t want to force you into something you don’t want to do.
I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off]
Okay, I’m Kareem. That makes total sense. I’m Kareem. You’re Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
And it went like this. [Jim’s phone starts ringing]
No one will believe this back home, but that’s okay. Let me show you how it’s done.
[Jim’s phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.
Hey honey, it’s me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you.
I’m just gonna go home. My mom’s been watching the kids all day.
Let her stay another hour. Let’s go get a beer.
Really? A beer sounds incredible right now.
Meredith, I am so sorry about today.
Right. I got the bartender’s phone number when you were in the john. I’m gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.
[Pam and Meredith singing karaoke] This one’s for all you ladies out there.
[singing] I come home in the middle of the night. My mother says when you gonna live your life right? Oh Mother dear, we’re not the fortunate ones. And girls, they want to have fun. Oh girls just want to have fun.
[on phone with Jim] I hope you’ve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it’s time for another episode of “Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire”.
Sorry, Stinky, can’t do it. Too busy.
Okay. There’s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.
Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim?
How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
Mmm. That’s a good… question. 300 times… [Jim hangs up] 180… Um that comes to 25 minutes. [realizes Jim hung up] Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.
Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim’s company.
Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?
Why don’t you come along and tell him yourself?
Ha ha. That’d be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get… What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn’t I think of this? Andy’s not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I’m expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?
Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything’s in order.
What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it’s in order? I [laughs] haven’t been trained for this.
Hey, look who’s back, Dwight Junior.
Hey, so how was it? I mean… the sex with Jan.
A gentleman doesn’t discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved.
Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, “Talk classy, act nasty”.
What, is it on backwards? [partially removes wig, revealing her bald head]
Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It’s an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so… bon appetite.
Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that’s Italian.
My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
Always with the friends Oscar. Can’t we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
Actually, it’s pronounced “espresso”… Wait. That’s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So…
There he is! [chuckles] We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but…
If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.
Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh… No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?
[sarcastically chuckling] I loved it.
How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
If it’ll lead to me being a salesman, I’ll pretend to be your friend.
Then looks like we have a deal… Son [holds up a suit identical to his]
Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.
Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso]
I don’t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone’s trust. About the pens.
I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy’s job in the bag until my interview.
Well, you shouldn’t be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.
Really, you can’t be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he’s basically Gumby with hair. [Darryl laughs]
[chuckling] It’s kind of funny, a father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store.
You know, you’re right! We hadn’t even thought of that, had we boy? [to Clark]
No, we sure hadn’t Pop. [both chuckling]
[Takes picture from desk] Oh! You’re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? [grabs Clark’s shoulder]
He calls me Clarky ‘cause he’s my Dad.
You don’t meet many hunters these days.
It was his birthday, just turned three. So…
You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?
It’s a thing. It means “you only live once”.
Yeah, we’re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
Alright everybody, who’s in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Don’t make us come over there.
Alright, let’s go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela]
Can’t I just agree without putting my hand in?
Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone else’s hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin]
[Meredith, Phyllis, Nellie, Angela, Creed, Oscar, Stanley] We all drink them all!
[in the background] Yes ma’am, you want to go east on Franklin, take that all the way to Commonweath. You’ll see us on the right side, you can’t miss us.
…And I want to reach every demographic possible.
No, I hear what you’re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
We’re talking weeks here, not months, right?
Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. [To Pam] Hey! How are you?
Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!
It’s pretty great, right? I mean, we’re coming along… [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis’s timeline
[back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
…But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark’s getting out of my car. He’s a good boy, does whatever I say.
[sighs] I can’t relate to that, my son hates my guts.
Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that?
[fumbling] Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they’re not even good. Really, they’re bad. Like you and your son.
[enters] Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but… God I missed you!
What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
[confused] I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.
[whispers to Clark] We don’t get along.
[catches on] Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is… our relationship is… terr-
Wow, this place is… so great. I had no idea – on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.
Well, I mean, I don’t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so… These things go down all the time.
If this company’s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.
[to Pam] Are you cool to just hang out?
A-bam! [slams espresso cup on table] My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I’ve tried so far is Alpine Select!
One! [as he picks Angela up in the air]
So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing.
I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
Here we go again, another lecture from the old man.
Maybe if you listened a little bit, you’d improve. No wonder women despise you.
His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam’s apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn’t see it, or didn’t wanna see it.
Alright, that’s enough, ‘cause I can say some things about him too.
Like the time that you got drunk and, and then… Killed those kids on their way to prom!
That never happened. He’s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught “saving treats” from the kitty litter box.
So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-
Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
There’s obviously a volume discount uh, if you-
Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going “please kitty, may I have some more?” You can’t make this stuff up!
No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends.
Hey fellas, sorry to keep you waiting.
[scoffs] Got cat turd collector written all over him.
…So definitely looking to expand our market, but for now we’re just concentrating on athletes that are popular here in the northeast. Of course, that’s not a mandate.
“Mandate”- Always think of two men on a date. [awkward moment] I have gay friends… I have one gay friend. [to Jim] Oscar?
Alright, so what makes you think you’d be a good fit here?
[freezes] Ummm… [a moment later] Alright. Obviously y’all look really busy, and uh, I don’t want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh… Obviously I’m not qualified to be here man, I’m…  I’m a warehouse manager, you know…
I’m a laywer. I’m the only one here who can honestly help. [group chuckles]
And as you know, I was a paper salesman. [whispers to Darryl] Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. [group overhears and chuckles]
So how about we start over, hmm? Darryl, do you have any thoughts on the company?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh… [pulls booklets from his bag] I wrote some down. There you go. [passes out booklets] Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me! [group laughs]
Ah! So, this is what 2:00 P.M. looks like around here!
[to Erin] Stocking pens, huh? You’re like the new office administrator.
No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it’s the truth, I swear.
Pam! Pam, look out! Erin’s gunning for your job!
No, I’m not! [Kevin imitates gunfire] It’s not like that at all! Forget it, I’m so sorry.
Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you’ve had.
By the way, Jim talks about you all the time.
That’s sweet that he talks about me.
It’s too bad he still hast to work part time in Scranton though…
Well, that’s funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.
I’m sorry, you guys are here to sell us paper?
Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?
I’d love to! Sam Junior here, he runs the business now. Kind of pushed me out, truth be told. I’m just here for human contract.
Well, thanks for coming down Darryl.
It was nice meeting you Darryl, I think you’d fit in great here.
Yeah, yeah me too. I think it’d be like… You know what? [grabs basketball] I think it’d be like a Kevin Durant jump shot… Perfecto! [shoots basketball at hoop on wall, basketball misses and lands in fish tank, killing the fish] Oh my god…
They’re the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It’s like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don’t blame Cece.
So I’m like a three year old girl in this scenario…
Say they don’t hire you. It’s not like you’re out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.
And I’d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I’m… I’m not so sure I’d like living in Philadelphia.
Right? Thank you! It’s just Philly. Everyone’s acting like it’s New York or Paris or London.
[enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They’re going to make you pay for the fish, and… they wanted to know when you can start.
What? [Jim shrugs] How about yesterday?
I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.
Yes, I love Philly! Two-One-Five or die!
No, I’m not upset. I’m really excited for Darryl… Maybe I’m a little disappointed that we’ll be losing him.
It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
It’s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
[banging on window] I don’t get the point of this stupid window!
I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dad’s suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. That’s why his face always breaks out.
Does that suit come with a fire extinguisher? [Clark chuckles]
You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I’m going to need one right? If I’m ever going to get a “real job” and move my “lazy ass” out of your “G.D. house”.
[to Clark in dressing room] That’s Italian silk. Very comfortable. Very tasteful… Although expensive.
Yeah, you don’t want Italian. You’ll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you’ll be doing life in Rikers Island.
Well, that’s better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.
That place doesn’t exist. It’s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
[emerges from dressing room wearing a sharp black suit] How do I look?
Actually… You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I’ll take one too.
Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don’t we move the copier into the annex like we’ve always wanted to?
One, two, three! [all gather around copier and push, tearing carpet beneath]
And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we’re going to be in so much trouble!
Wait! [looking at the hardwood floor beneath the carpet] It’s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That’s how you do that, baby. It’s all good, I’m ready. Y’all ready for this? [sings intro to “Everybody dance now”, points to Pam to sing first line]
[reluctantly] Everybody dance now… [Darryl continues singing]
Kevin, move. I can’t pull up the rug if you’re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
Well I can’t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
Oh, enough with the whining already! Why don’t you just have some more coffee?
It’s all gone. I didn’t get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.
Hey, it’s five o’clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot]
Yes! We did it! [leaving the suit store]
And you closed it. The boys are back in town. [high fives Clark] High fives! Ha ha!
Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?
You got me! [tickles Clark and chuckles] I used to collect them!
Each one is very different, like a snowflake.
[shocked after seeing the torn up carpet] Hey… What happened here?
You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That’s what happened. The pens happened.
I think I’m a little too busy these days to s— [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. [holding note over lamp] Invisible ink.
“Higher than numbers go.” The ceiling above accounting!
[on phone]: Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end …
…and finds the… fake grail? No grail?
Annex. It must open something in the annex.
[shouts while cutting up seat cushion – gasps upon finding playing cards]
[murmuring as Dwight holds up toy forklift]
[on phone to Jim] There’s nothing down here.
Oh, I expected more from young Halpert.
Let’s just forget it. Forget it. [warehouse worker dips donut into golden chalice]
So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?
Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.
And then we had him “Like” Dunder Mifflin.
Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them “Like” Derek’s “Likes.”
So far, we’re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.
You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together.
Pete and I work well together — not that there’s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy… or girl– not that I’m into girls. Not that I’m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
Hey Jim. Peter Rowley at Bridgeport Capital requested a meeting at lunch.
Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
Cece’s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I’ve been working with her on her move. It’s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It’s kind of like this. It’s pretty cute, right?
Pfft, “Athlead”? Please. They’re too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it “Stumpany,” for “Stupid Company.”
Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That’s why I’m doing it.
Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I’m switching over.
[on phone] Hey, Halpert, what’s the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you’re stealing Darryl too. When will it end?
Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
You won’t stop until you’ve poached us all.
No. I’ll be damned if I’m gonna let us lose me.
Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?
Ooh, I haven’t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?
Oh, no, Kevin, it’s not a joke. Angela’s husband put me up for a– um, just never mind.
I have no information. But I’m sure as soon as they know, they’ll call you.
Well, I’m heading out to Cece’s dance recital.
Hey, Cece, Daddy’s gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?
It’s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I’m stuck here trying to keep him on board.
Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren’t gonna make it.
Pam, I couldn’t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
You’re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy’s gonna record it. So we’ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.
Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you’re not the best with the phone.
I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we’re getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, “Bye, Daddy.”
Bye.  [pause] Yep. See, you’ve still got to press “End,” Pam.
Oh, check it out. This is our first real “Like.”
Oh! All right, Alan Olson from North Dakota. He also likes Hammermill and Georgia Pacific.
We did it. Youth task force forever.
[doing a series of hand bumps with Erin] Bap, bup, bup, bap. Wait. Did I go first and then you?
All right, all right.Okay, start over.
Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around — on me. Just sign your name below.
Wait. This says “Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge”?
This — uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.
Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I’m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you’ve got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? “Infuriating, irresponsible”…
They got us set up with Windows 95,  so you’re kind of dreaming here.
Okay, I’m gonna need you to print it out.
[writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it’s an idea. But what does it mean?
Ooh, it’s when you get a free sandwich after you’ve already eaten ten sandwiches.
Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority– the client.
Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It’s very unlikely it would happen again.
No, you’re not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl?  L–
Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let’s all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?
But he’s flirting with Jim’s company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to.
I’m sorry. Do I still need to be here?
I’m having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let’s– let’s use an example. Take Erin. Erin’s boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.
So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example?
No, let’s– let’s– let’s not say Creed. Let’s say Mr. X.
Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.
Oh, I’m sorry. Didn’t you cheat on Andy?
Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?
Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that’s the guy that Erin’s flirting with?
Ladies and gentlemen, the Little Ladybug Ballerinas.
[whispering] Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural? [Loudly] Oh, my God!
[whispering] Um, I’m sorry. I have to go. My daughter’s a ladybug. I know that doesn’t make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you.
Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?
Dwight, look, I’m sorry you’re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
It can’t be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?
Well, Andy’s cute, but he’s too vanilla, whereas Pete – he’s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.
I’m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven’t done anything.
Yeah right. With slammin’ bods like that, they ain’t playing checkers.
People, it’s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that’s the end of it. Right, Pete?
That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from?
Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart… and a little bit your penis.
Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I’m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.
I suppose that will– that will be all right, yeah.
Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You’re welcome, Andy. And you’re welcome, my own ass.
Listen, I appreciate you taking the time with me.
Peter, please. We completely understand your concerns here. Let us just show you the latest projections. Jim?
Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he’s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s–
Oh, actually… uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he’ll be calling in any second.
[on phone] Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.
Hey boss, you gotta jump on a delivery.
All right, let’s get this over with.
You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! [laughs] Here we go! Yeah!
Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!
How far is this place? [turns off radio]
Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]
Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there.
Oh, thank you. I don’t know, I sort of thought–
[hugging Nellie] So proud of you, Hon.
I’m just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin?
Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I– I just sort of felt I owed him one.
Pete’s a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat.
I didn’t really think about it like that.
Yeah, well… Not everybody has what we have.
I just remembered… I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no.
Yes. Fast food. I’ll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
It’s 30 degrees out. You drinkin’ a mildshake?
Nope. [throwing milkshake] Fire in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that’s what working at a paper company’s all about!
Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k– We have to go.
You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
It’s a youtube thing! Let’s go. Let’s go. Come on, they’re coming.
Anyone want to see the video from Cece’s recital?
Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped… with that [picks up piece of paper].
I’ll watch it. Let’s get this over with.
[recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work.
Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.
User error. I’ve heard of that happening to other people.
Oscar, don’t rub it in. I’m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.
Well, it was an important phone call.
I haven’t told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he’s always like, “Beesly!” I love that. Only thing better than getting the job– “Beesly!” [chuckles]
[cleaning up milkshake in restaurant] It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
Fire in the hole! [throwing milkshake] Go! Go! Go! Go! [tires screech]
Ha ha! Yeah, joke’s on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!
I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force.
Oh, no, I really don’t think that’s a good idea.
Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it.
What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?
We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It’s like everything I did, he just wouldn’t go for it.
I have no idea where we’re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
[sighs] Oh, I’m sorry. I feel like you’ve already been working insanely hard.
Can you figure out how to upload Cece’s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
Um, actually, funny story — I didn’t get it. I shouldn’t have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.
You’re not serious, are you? You didn’t get any of the recital?
No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.
Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
Yeah, okay, I’m sorry. I’m sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.
Oh, great. So we’ll see somebody else’s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it’s really not that hard to film a video.
Is there– um… you want to ease up a little bit?
Look, Pam, I don’t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It’s gone. That moment’s just gone. I missed it.
I don’t know, Jim — maybe you should have been there.
You’re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I’m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You’ve agreed to this.
You know what? I– I– I don’t think you want to start a conversation with me about what’s fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever —
Pam, I’m not explaining this to you– Pam, I’m not going over this again.
I don’t know how else to tell you, okay? I’m doing everything I can every week to bring home something…
I am– I am– I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.
I’m doing this just for me? Is that what I’m doing? I’m doing it just for me. If that’s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
Nothing. You’re doing the best you can.
Give her a minute. Give her a minute.
Hey, it’s just a tough situation, all right?
It’s getting tougher. I just didn’t know that it was gonna be this hard.
Yeah. Let’s turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough.
[on video] Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go!
[on video] I nailed that guy, dude. Oh yeah.
[on video] Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go! I nailed that guy, dude. Oh, yeah.
[sighs] I’m gonna miss the paper business.
It’s fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you. [phone rings]
[in background] Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.
Well, thanks for being a good friend.
Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away?
Uh, listen, they’re cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It’s a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna… I, I’ll see you later.
Hey, so I hear you’re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?
That’s right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.
You know what, man? I deserve this job.
I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond… and under.
You know what? You’re gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you’re going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
Clark has no chance. I mean, he’s up against my buddy Rolf, for God’s sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor – he’ll make you laugh so hard, you’ll puke your pants.
This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.
Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
You could’ve just called that an alliance too, right?
Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that’s only gonna make things worse.
[sighs] You interviewing for the sales job too?
No. You’re interviewing for it. I’m getting it.
Well, I wouldn’t be so sure about that. I mean, I’ve been working here 12 weeks. That’s a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we’ve seen.
Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl.
Hey. Come on, buddy. Let’s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first.  You don’t compare. When you’re with the R-O-L-F, you’re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]
Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.
When are you talking to David Wallace?
I’m talking to him this afternoon, but don’t get your hopes up.
Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we’re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix – me asking the boss of the company I’m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So… problem solved. Thanks, guys.
And this chair’s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
I’m just gonna call you back. Thanks.
I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I don’t do earbuds.
[sighs] It’s fine. It’s just a seating arrangement. Doesn’t matter.
So I’ve got your resume here, but it’s not telling me everything.
Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you’re qualified to evaluate me?
I’ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I’m an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
I think I’ve heard everything I need to hear.
Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I’m sure he’d give a reference.
Thank you, Dwight. I’ll be in touch.
Well, they can’t all be winners. But Trevor’s next and he’s a real professional. You say, “Jump,” and he says, “Oh who?” He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.
What makes you think you’d be an effective paper salesman?
Ooh, okay. Didn’t see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it.
Well, it’s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking?
[chuckles] Nothing gets by this guy.
Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?
Thanks, dude. You—you sure it’s okay? ‘Cause you’re kinda—
Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You’re clean, right?
Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don’t listen to it at all because we’re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so—
Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?
Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
I need you to breathe in my face right now.
What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
I looked at you coming around, and I said, “Wintergreen.”
I can’t hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.
Okay, here’s one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.  You can’t rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.
That’s just a classic no-win situation.
Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond …
This interview’s over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru’d the whole process.
Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?
Oh, you think they’re my only friends? I’ve got way more friends than that, and they’re all better than the losers who work here.
Just – I don’t wanna make assumptions based on people’s physical appearances.
Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?
If I ever get that bad, you’d tell me, right?
[chuckles] Walked right into that one.
Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He’s got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I’ve got big expectations, Mose-wise.
What quality would make you a good sales associate?
It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
And I’ve never seen you go to work, ever.
So why is this on your resume? [door slams]
So how’d you guys hear about the position?
Dwight called my house, but he didn’t realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I can’t stay out of her stuff.
Dwight’s my cousin, so I overheard him telling my brother Mose about the job opportunity in the shower.
You were in the shower or he was in the shower?
Everyone was in the shower. It’s a cow shower, so there’s like, a ton of people in there.
So you guys all know Dwight already?
I was his babysitter, and then we dated for a while. He was a passionate lover and the sweetest little baby.
I knew you looked familiar. You used to pick up Dwight from school.
You went to X-Men school too? [exhales]
Oh, I have a few powers. Night hearing. Dogs understand where I point. And our training included picking carrots, scrubbing tubs, sewing imitation Levi’s. A lot of telemarketing.
I don’t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn’t work then. And now look what he’s doing to us.
Here’s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others.
But it’s Dwight who’s bring in all the weirdos.
Yeah, but Jim, Dwight’s a weirdo. We can’t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
Hey, I’m the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim’s away. I’m in a position where I’m rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. [sighs] Forget it.  I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.
[on phone] Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later.
Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input—
[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don’t lie. I can tell if you’re lying.
Jim says he’d like some say in the hiring process.
Really? That’s interesting. ‘Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who’s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.
I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife—
Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work.
Okay. I can’t say that that’s not fair.
And I know we have a call scheduled for later –
Oh, yeah, so we’ll just do that later.
Uh… [clears throat] Well, it’s about Athlead. I’m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
There’s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor –
Okay. Jim, I’m gonna have to stop you right there.
I’d like to give you $100 million. [snickers] [phone ringing]
Why you make trees into bushes? You don’t make paper from bushes.
Hide, they’re giving out jobs upstairs. Why don’t you go up and get one?
[patting Darryl’s hair] It’s dense. Like bread.
Dwight, you can’t just hire someone ‘cause they’re your friend.
I’m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
They’re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.
You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.
Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch.
Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.
Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ‘em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.
Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad.
No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.
Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. It’s over.
Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You’re still at the 570 number?
I have eight years experience selling electronics in Sanyo store in downtown Tokyo. I was a doctor. And I have a business degree from Tokyo University.
[groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]
Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? I’ve been double-parked for five hours. I’m wondering if I should move my car.
No, you’ve been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.
Well, the joke’s on them. I live right next to the tow yard. All they did was save me some gas.
Hey man, we get how difficult this is. And no matter how you choose, we’re still gonna be your friend.
Yeah, whether it’s me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvina—
Yeah, you’d bring us all down here, put us through the wringer and then choose none of us.
Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you.
Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.
Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I’m not looking south, I’m not livin’.  That’s what I always say.
And I was thinking it’s only fair that you help make this decision since they’ll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
But you know I wouldn’t hire any of these all-stars.
Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it’s your call.
Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn’t picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
Wow. So much crap. It’s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?
Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.
Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert’s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.
No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Don’t open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe.
Guys, it wasn’t up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn’t my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.
Yeah, it’s that weird hour where it’s too late to start a slow roast and too early for a Swanson’s.
Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?
[yelling] And what are we supposed to do until then?
Yeah. No limit on weapons class, right?
So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that’ll print out—Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.
Okay. I’m really sorry I told the guys I’d be there for the board meeting.
Take care of my wife. I will be back.
They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
Hey, Pam, I’m going to the kitchen. You want anything?
Oh, I’m sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee.
Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?
Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I’ll distract him, you take that.
Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that’s great.
Yeah, Darryl’s here. So is Santa Claus. It’s just a regular Thursday. [checks for anyone around] Neither guy is here. And, it’s Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl’s world of lies.
Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I’m his helper. It’s so fun.
[as Darryl descends stairs, Erin ascends carrying a giant teddy bear] Darryl. Meet… bear… ull.
Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
Everybody knows I go to Philly. I’ve just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
[exiting Darryl’s office] Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! [to Phyllis] That guy’s hilarious. He’s here today. [giant teddy bear is viewed in Darryl’s office]
Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It’s Phillip’s first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.
Aw, cute! So there’ll be a bunch of kids.
No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping… [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation…
No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
[undertone] Angela. You’re going to find out, so I thought I’d let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
He said he wanted me there for support.
Angela’s husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me.
[on phone with Robert] We agreed that you wouldn’t be seen with him in public. It’s humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
[in Darryl and Jim’s Philly apartment] Hey.
We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates.
And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it’s, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
Which usually means there’s clothes all over the living room.
And this dude labels his food. He’s the clean one. And, I’m the messy one. How much fun is this?
I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It’s just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn’t wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to [quote-unquote fingers] soak… He hooked me up with a job.
Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.
Yes sir. [notices Jim’s using his coffee mug]
[entering office] Conference room. Everybody. Now!
You don’t have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff… That’s gonna be revealed once we’re in the conference room for the meeting.
You’re telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
Let’s go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
[to everyone in conference room] I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.
I thought that’s what you were doing.
Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
I don’t think so, but they put paint where I didn’t want paint. So…
I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is… OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.
Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men’s room wall. Which is so messed up. It’s 6782 not 83.
Uh, 6783’s also a good time. Less mileage.
Yes. Thank you. Let’s answer that question.
I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.
[as everyone begin to leave] No, no. Come on, guys. Don’t go.
If there’s anything I hate worse than art, it’s crime.
Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored.
I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I’m pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.
[enters quickly] You need my pitchfork?
[approaches Dwight as he leaves] Hey!
What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
Exciting news. There’s room for one more at my son’s birthday event. And, I want you.
What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
If I get the deicing gig, it’s not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. [exits]
Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can’t come to your son’s birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
OK. I understand. I’ll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
[in warehouse] I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one’s business but my own.
You’re gonna to compare ‘um to the butts up there. [gestures mural]
Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
All right then, they’re bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws.
OK, OK. I think it’s time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let’s go.
Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts…
We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.
We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. [holds up phone] Nate. Your mother is dying. [Nate reacts with grief]
So, she’s gonna pull through again? [all nod] That’s great. Can I talk to her?
Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let’s talk about this mural business.
You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we’ve got chewing gum.
Gum’s gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of it’s just too minty. It’s like they’re literally trying to hurt…
[interrupting] Tell us who defaced the mural!
[points at Warehouse Worker Frank] He did it.
All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
There’s no gum. There never was any gum.
[at Phillip’s party] Opening with pub pastries? That’s a bold play. They’re saying, it’s only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
[noticing a portrait of Angela on the wall] That painting is just… How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
Ladies and gentlemen, Senator and Angela Lipton. [guests applaud]
Thanks, everybody. Thanks for coming. Phillip had no idea he was so popular.
[laughs] Oh, Robert, you’re horrible. [to other guests] Simon, Maxine. [sarcastically] Who let you guys in here?
[points to Jim and Darryl] This is the team.
[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I’m sorry about that.
It’s cool. Reading’s tricky sometimes.
Oh, um… Are you really mad about this?
That’s my go-to thermos. That’s all.
Oh. It’s your go-to therm. Oh, man. That’s a bummer. I’m sorry about that.
No, no. If it’s a big deal, it’s a big deal.
[as Jim empties thermos into trash] Nah, nah, nah. You don’t have to do that.
Honestly, I don’t mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or…
I don’t know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos]
So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?
[Warehouse Worker Frank remains silent, picks ear] You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank?
I’m sorry I didn’t like your crappy doodles. I drew a butt. Big deal. Butts are funny.
Well, I didn’t think that butt was funny.
Well, maybe if you got the stick out of yours.
You know what? You people can’t fire me. So, screw you. [exits]
Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
There were two or three ‘sorry’s in there. [mumbles along with Nellie]
That sucked. He didn’t apologize. There’s no talking to that guy.
Oh, your little feelings party didn’t work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
I’m saying we should go scorched earth on that guy’s face.
Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I’m like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.
He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that’s important to him.
I know just the man for the job. [looks at Clark]
One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
Yes. We’re good friends. Good friends.
I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It’s cool?
[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It’s mine. Don’t worry.
I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn’t use that?
What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?
Darryl, it doesn’t matter. I think you know the point I’m trying to make.
All right, I’m being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just… you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That’s all.
Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It’s mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.
Silence. You’ll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
OK, boss. [quietly] Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you’re smarter than this.
[to Darryl on phone] Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?
He’s not my hire, but I know who he is.
OK. What does he like? What’s important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or…
What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate… never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband’s like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair]
Hold on a second. Uh, Sandeep? Let’s get you closer to the senator. Just about there. Great. And, Oscar? I’m gonna need you to step a little closer to the senator, as well. Somewhere there.
[to party waiter] Excuse me, uh, what’s your name?
LaShawn. Great. You wanna be in a photo? Right this way. [notices overweight man following] Not you. No.
Let’s just wheel Margaret right in front…
Smile. [Angela attempts to get in front of Oscar as pictures are taken]
I’m done. What are you… Is that supposed to be my mural?
Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I’m drawing your mural on Frank’s truck’s butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
Oh, no. Um, I, I’m embarrassed. It’s stupid.
This is amazing! Frank! And he’s leaving a trail of poops?
Good. I’m glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
Ugh! Don’t sympathize. You’re ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.
I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It’s gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very…
[exiting building and approaching Pam] Lady! My truck? You had no right!
So? So someone need to shut you up! [attempts to attack Pam]
Hey, hey, hey! [knocks Frank down with boom microphone]
[as Frank gets up] Easy! [Frank grabs him]
Thanks so much for coming. Thanks so much. [to Oscar and Angela] Well. Have we all calmed down yet?
Let’s all try to do better next time. Kevin, great to see you.
Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you’re just using them. Again, the food was very good. [Oscar and Angela exit looking pleased]
Well, I’m gonna say something to the producers.
You shouldn’t be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.
It’s all good. I knew what I was doing. It’s… I’m sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that.
No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy’s an animal. I’m glad they’re firing him too.
Look. I don’t, I don’t wanna put myself where I don’t belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And I’ll be there for you.
Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that’s just ‘Roommates 101’.
[playing video game with Jim] Oh. Come on!
[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?
[makes magic trick hand gesture] Alakazam!
By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
And, poof! He disappears. [Jim snaps, playing along]
[to Pete] Hey! Wanna play hookey today?
Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind?
[has an idea and reveals a frisbee from under her desk] Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
Perfect. [Pete walks away eying the camera knowingly]
[knocks on Andy’s door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in.
[talking to Andy’s empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
[pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.
Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I’ve been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It’s been yummy. But now, Andy’s coming back. So, I guess it’s goodbye chunky, lemon milk.
[to entire office]OK, I’ll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.
I say we all have one last fun boss-less day.
Yeah, let’s get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences.
Phil, I’ll pretend to be your husband. I’m already sick of you, so it’ll seem realistic.
They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. [to Meredith] They use a watch repair kit.
[to Angela] Ew! I’ll be your foot buddy.
Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount.
It’s what I do. [everyone begins to leave]
Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the…
No… yes, yes. Why wouldn’t I… wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.
All right, it’ll be easy. Don’t be nervous, just follow my…
[interrupting] Stop talking ’bout it. I said I’m fine with it.
Oh, hey, don’t fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.
I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.
Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That’s good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
I’m very excited to see Brian. Brian’s a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I’m sorry, but you know him. He’s a good guy.
Oh, tiny, poor lady is back. Oh, get the baby clipper. [other nails stylists gush over Angela]
[to Clark] You take off your glasses.
Your boyfriend. He look like a pretty girl.
My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn’t he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra. [both laugh at Clark]
Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount. [to nail manager] Excuse me. [gesturing he and Nellie] Full price. We’re not together.
Turns out, I can’t even be in a pretend relationship.
[to nail manager] Hi. We’d like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
No. No discount for two men. Two men are not a couple.
Two men? [other nail stylist speaks Korean to manager, both laugh] [gestures index fingers bumping together] Doesn’t work. No discount.
Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we’re taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands]
[enters restaurant with Pam] Hey, Brian.
Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread.
He’s on a no carb thing. Supposedly.
It’s, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming.
Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I’ve wanted the opportunity to say thanks for… everything. And I’m really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
It’s fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I’m fully available.
Well, my dad can’t hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.
That’s… OK, great. Does he pay well?
Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa’s, she’s not gonna make it today.
Actually, we’re not gonna make it. Um… we’re splitting up.
[to Andy’s empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign.
[acting as Andy] Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don’t know how you do it. You’re a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
[in his office doorway, bearded and unkept] Hi Dwight.
You’re back. [surveys Andy] And you’re disgusting.
[as everyone returns to the office] Ah, geez. My nails aren’t dry yet. I don’t think I can work for at least a couple hours.
I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived.
Hey! Sweetheart! [approaches Erin] I have missed you so much.
[obviously avoiding Andy’s embrace] Yes. [gives Andy high fives] Welcome back, buddy.
[attempting to hug Erin as she resists] I have been dreaming of this moment.
I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I’m still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.
What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
Hey, Burning Man, if it’s not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.
Obviously, that’s why I’m here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine’s Day, sweetheart. [tries to embrace Erin but she begins playing cloppers] But, I’m just saying, I’m also excited about the Wallace meeting.
Why? Isn’t he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?
No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he’s been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you’ve been gone for the last three months?
I have no idea. I don’t know what he knows or doesn’t know. But we’ve been in touch the whole time. I mean, it’s not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It’s in every Bembe cafe.
He and Pam are having their Valentine’s Day lunch.
So, you’re concerned about peoples’ long absence from their place of work?
If the shoe fits. [plays güiro and sings, Kevin echoes]
We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb.
Well, I mean, that’s OK. It doesn’t mean that it’s over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
At least my crying won’t get you fired.
I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.
Well, there’s one problem. Couldn’t help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So… gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.
OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word ‘coolio’.
No! [Andy makes a call] What do you think you’re doing?
Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.
I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.
Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.
Seriously? You’re calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you’re doing?
No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.
It, it’s, it’s actually just an issue…
You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.
No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.
Jan, I don’t know what he’s talking about but…
Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.
Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.
[approaching Accounting] Hey, everybody, great job. [to Angela] Listen, we’re a smidge behind on my paychecks.
Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven’t been here for 12 Fridays. [hands Andy a folder]
All right. Thank you very much. [examines checks] Looking good. [after noticing something on Angela’s desk] Who’s that little fella?
It’s a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it’s targets over the past quarter.
A quarter’s three months. That’s how long you’ve been gone.
Uh-huh… [after awkward pause] Uh-huh. [Angela hands him the bonus check] Thank you. Great. Well, we’re all up to speed.
Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
[emotional] Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week.
He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
God! I just don’t know what we’d do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
I’d like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I’m a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.
I’m not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don’t you?
Meredith Palmer ain’t never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That’s me. Flesh hoover?
Meredith, that’s plenty. All right? That’s more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?
Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he’s gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don’t want that on my hands.
Fine! The state he’s in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.
[appears approaching group, shaved and in a suit] What’s going on in here, dirty players? Let’s get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on. [singing] Who’s that girl? Who’s that girl? It’s Andy! [resumes talking] All right. Back to work.
OK, I can tell you’re mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don’t know, tell me why?
I didn’t tell you about the crying because I didn’t want you to know how upset I was. Because it would’ve stressed you out and you’re always saying how much you don’t want more stress.
Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.
No, you’re right. And, and I’m not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don’t have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn’t there. So, let’s just forget about it.
I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.
Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.
Not helpful. Let’s stay positive, people. OK?
Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.
Sounds great. Don’t let me interrupt. What ever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldn’t be happier with the numbers.
Well, finish up. I’m gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?
[whispering] We had to let a warehouse guy go?!
[interrupting] … lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
This is what I’m talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?
Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin.
Yeah. In the European billboards, she’s gonna be topless.
Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.
The warehouse fire. Weren’t you just down there? It’s like burnt to ashes.
[catches on to the ruse] I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that’s one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.
I think you’ll agree I explained that pretty well.
All right. Everyone! [waves to office and exits]
[enters Andy’s office to find him playing güiro] Fish sounds great.
Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?
I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn’t really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don’t love you.
OK, I get it. You’re unhappy. I’ve been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.
On your side. But there’s tons on my side. It’s gushing. We’re just out of sync right now. But that’s just timing, it’s timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.
I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we’re lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.
I’m gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.
I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won’t be able to tell the difference. So, I’ll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you’ll actually start to love me again.
You really think we can get that back?
You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I’m sure you have stuff to do. So we can just… I don’t know, drop me at the bus station?
Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine’s Day. Sorry, I didn’t have time to wrap it.
[sees it’s a drawing of hers, framed] Wow. I didn’t know you kept this.
I don’t think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.
You really wanna fight on Valentine’s Day?
OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
Oh, you don’t have to apologize. I just… I just want you to be happy. OK? [Erin smiles and kisses Pete]
[bursts into Andy’s office] We’re breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
[on phone] Hey, Andy. It’s David. Still here. What was that about three months?
Really? [reading from phone] “Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA.”
And all was good in Scranton PA that day.
Oscar says “hi” all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. “Hi” “Hello” “Hola” You’re telling me you’ve never heard Oscar say “hi”?
By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you’ve been telling lately.
Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] “Hey Andy, all’s well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife’s sick.” Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!
Erin just dumped me and I can’t remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.
I wouldn’t own the company if it wasn’t for you. So…I owe you that.
David, I’ll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I’ll be there for you. That’s a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it.
We are even…now. Understand? Got it?
You are on very- Hey, very thin ice.
Vanilla. [David looks confused] Vanilla Ice. It was a band.
And how are you on this fine- [chokes up, runs into office and slams door pulling the blinds closed]
[Moaning from office] Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh
Should’ve put him out of his misery and just fired her.
I can’t be around sad people, it makes me sad.
Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn’t know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete’s butt. It’s sick.
[taking paper from Kevin] Oh that’s mine! Um, I’ll just, I’ll get it out of the way for you.
[Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.
And you should take breaks more often, I’ve been waiting there for 45 minutes.
It’s my aunt Shirley, she’s on her last legs.
You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it’s all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was “poisoned” by Aunt Shirley.
Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
Ok, well I’m very sorry about your aunt.
But I don’t see how this is my problem.
Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she’s an old woman Angela. She needs a woman’s touch. It’s all hanging out-
And there’s parts of her I don’t even recognize.
There’s this one hanging part in particular, that’s some sort of flap.
It’s like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
..where it was and it needs, it needs a…
Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?
Well then, I don’t want them. You can keep ’em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.
Nope, I insist upon it. It’s an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.
These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
I don’t want to talk about work right now.
Well I only want to talk about work right now.
Then I want my big blue sweater back.
Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?
I don’t know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men.
Survey says: ENH! Doesn’t make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?
Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you’ve got your freedom now.
Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.
You just let it all hang out, that’s what…
May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you. [Andy leaves]
I’ll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
Aunt Shirley, Hello! It’s me Dwight.
Oh, lookie here. It’s big city Dwight. Careful you don’t get mud on those fancy town shoes, big city Dwight.
Who’s this little kitchen witch? She’s so tiny like a little kitchen witch.
This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
New clothes? What for? [Aunt Shirley’s boob shows]
You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela’s gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
How would you like a mean cold slap? [slaps Angela]
Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
Why doesn’t Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn’t she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.
Andy, don’t. No good can come from snooping.
I’m not snooping, there’s just some crud on her screen.
Uh, hello! Who’s snooping on who now?
Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I’m psycho again. Uh, couldn’t shake this feeling that Erin’s dating someone so I looked at her phone.
Man, you can’t do that stuff. You’ll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
Too late. I found out she’s been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?
It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.
Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?
[pointing to Jim’s bluetooth headset] What’s that? Is that a-
Ok, I know where you’re going with this, and this is who I am now. I’m a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]
Gotta go, VIP just walked through the door.
How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.
Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.
Of course, anything for Team Halpert. You’re gonna crush it, Pam.
You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.
[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?
Hey, Jim! We’ve got Trent Edwards on the line.
I’ve gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You’re gonna crush it, you’re gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!
Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
Now all it takes is half a liter. She’s dreaming. Alright, let’s get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
No, it’s a lot better than it sounds. There’s a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap.
No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You’re fired!
Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. [singing] So you had a bad day-
Out of my office, turns out you’re fired…
You can’t fire Pete. You understand why, right?
Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can’t just get rid of people over grudges.
Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.
Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin.
They already have a contract? [Reading] “Mutually agree to-” Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.
It’s just boiler plating, you don’t have to read it.
Well, I’m not signing away my rights.
I already signed it. I was just showing you.
Ok, well we’ll see about that. [crumples paper]
Andy, it’s not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy. [Andy throws paper at him and leaves, Toby straightens paper out] It’s the original.
…[singing] talking Chester avenue, talking triplex, talking converting…Is that her? Hey guys! Say something.
I’m the horrible boss around here, but please don’t hire Jamie Foxx to kill me. D’Jango! I don’t agree with the use of the “N” word in that movie. It’s, it’s too soon.
It’s hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You’re gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
Let’s do it! Ready? Here’s a box cutter to get her clothes off.
Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
[grunting] I’m gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It’s the shortest month but it sure doesn’t feel that way. We should catch up.
Y’know I’ve been going over my notes from the trial…
…feel like I may have glossed over a few…
No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.
For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don’t want to hear it!
Step this way for The Spanish Inquisition! [laughs] Kids in the Hall. Just, it’s not high pressure. Just a little Coffee Talk. Ok? Like butta. Come on in here. Mike Myers.
Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.
Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk….
Kid doesn’t have a romantic bone in his body.
You’ve got a booger bubble going on there.
This is a tiny resume. Papa Smurf! Come back to the mushroom. [Pam laughs] From The Smurfs movie.
Yeah, I’ve seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I’ve actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-
What does this say here? To ti te per tat… what language is this? Swahili? Oh wait a second, now I can read it.
Oh, cause it was upside down. [both laugh]
You’re a good audience. [Pam laughs]
Unlike some of these people around here.
Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
You wrote Art and Painting, kinda the same thing. Kinda the same thing. Sometimes I repeat myself, but that’s just being Pam. Well I’m kinda cute and I’m- but I’m married so…leave that be.
Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation: penis. Translation? My manhood.
Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you’ve gotta move on.
Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.
Listen to him, Andy. He’s trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.
Just, get over it. It doesn’t have to be awkward.
Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you’ve just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don’t want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that’s fun.
Nothing to see here! Boss at work. This will be your desk. Right up front. Best seat on the roller coaster, you must be this tall to ride this ride. No pregnant women allowed. Are you? Uh, yeah I don’t- not allowed to ask. So…
I didn’t ask her if she was pregnant. She just offered it. The last three girls here all got pregnant.
Don’t be afraid, it’s a different chair. I don’t want a guy up here. I want to you know, see a woman come in and do a great job. Something that, I have to look out this window, I want someone-
I’m sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
It is. Yeah, you would uh manage this office. Answer the phones and forward the calls and uh you know, go for a coffee run now and again.
Well, I think they indulge themselves a little too much. I like scripted.
I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can’t.
Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
I’m going to the prison. This afternoon. I’m gonna talk to the strangler.
Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler.
Don’t use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It’s a devil name.
Well I just wanted to say I’m doing it. [Toby leaves]
Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-
I can’t wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don’t eat because I’m ordering in.
I’ll make it worth your while, I promise.
Sure. I mean, it’s Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I’ll see you at eight.
I’m here from BCI Marketing Consultants to meet with Andrew Bernard.
Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
Fresh meat! Fresh meat! [Making kissing noises]
Just keep walking, don’t give her anything. She’ll take it and run. I’m Erin by the way.
Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I’m bad at small talk.
History. Wow, ok. We dated for two years.
Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. [runs to front office]
Hey Erin, look who’s back. The bird man.
We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.
Hi, I’m uh, Toby Flenderson. I’m here to see George Howard Scubb.
He worked as a librarian freshman year.
Is there like somebody who’s in charge of marketing? Maybe I should sit near him or her.
Hi. [laughs] Good. I’d love to discuss strategy with you if you have a marketing p-
Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you’ve contrived.
[high pitched] Really uncomfortable situation.
It’s alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta “move on”. Ain’t that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How’s that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm. [leaves]
So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
You must be pretty horny. [Erin shakes head no]
And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
You’re welcome. Would you like some stew?
By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
No, you don’t eat it. It’s a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
That’s what Mose said about his lady scarecrow and look what he did to that poor thing.
Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?
Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn’t get the job.
Oh man. I’m so sorry. Are you alright?
Oh, yeah. I’m more than alright. There’s just nothing to celebrate.
Are you kidding? We’re in Philly. We’re having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It’s from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
[laughs] You’re very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.
It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight.
Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
Leave him. He probably won’t even notice that you’re gone. Be with me, Monkey.
I’m not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life…I want to spend with you.
Stand by your man. It’s what I would want if you were mine.
How are you doing? Is it really rough?
Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.
Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone’s day?
Really? Hmm. That’s interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn’t be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?
I still wear Erin’s button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we’re still in a relationship-
And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.
Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy.
Ok, while we’re rewriting history, you never had a drinking problem.
It was college. That is what you do.
Yeah you’re also supposed to go to classes, so there’s that.
Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
We’ll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?
[laughs] Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn’t even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out.
Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
I didn’t ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing.
So you’re dating a secretary now? Moving up in the world, Pete.
How’s that P.E. degree coming? That’s what he wanted to be. His dream in college was to be a gym teacher.
Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let’s-
I technically cannot. I don’t have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.
What kind of music are you into, Peter?
Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe.
Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan?
He is not a very sophisticated man, I mean he can’t even use chopsticks, so. Do I need to say anything else?
Erin, I’ve been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night.
I don’t want you to shave everything.
I wasted two years of my life on you, you realize that right?!
I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man. [Erin and Gabe argue in background]
I am as smooth as a porpoise. {Erin argues]
Why don’t you say in the beginning: “This isn’t really going that well”
Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? [Erin & Gabe and Alice & Pete argue in background] Yeah. Yeah, it does.
So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.
Tell me about the cologne. How much?
You’re definitely hoarding this by the way.
Guess what poster he had on his wall?
[laughs] No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.
I’m sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
I don’t know, but it’s interesting right?
He said he can’t help but tear up when he looks at it. It’s like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
That’s amazing. Well, listen. You can’t win ’em all, right?
So, next interview has to be better.
What do you mean? Of course it will. You’re amazing.
I know. It’s just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don’t know, I don’t know if I want, um, I don’t know if I want this.
[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.
Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.
And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs]
My grandfather know. Mah Jong will be here to stay. Hobbies of the East continues in a moment.
You could all be doing this, just saying.
I watch way too many ads online and I don’t do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
Why can’t you just do regular sit-ups?
I’ll tell you why. Because…the floor…is…disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that’s how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?
Oh, why don’t your famous stomachs help you now?
Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please? [Erin moves Oscar out of the way for Phyllis]
Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
Oh, Dwight. I’m so sorry. Were you guys close?
I would say that she raised me, but let’s not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
My actual mother was very cold and distant. I’d say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday’s funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
[after Dwight tosses dirt on her face] What color is it?
[after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right.
[while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
I’m so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just… have a personal training session…
OK. That’s not… [tosses red dirt in Oscar’s face]
I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should’ve kept my mouth shut. We’re not even that close. I’ve only known Dwight… 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
[as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I’m sure… I’m sure she’s in a better place.
I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam’s face]
OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can’t make a dirt ball.
You know? [Dwight screams and throws dirt ball at Jim]
[playing guitar and singing ‘Oh What a Beautiful Morning’] Zeke’s here.
[simultaneously with Zeke] Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
[at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here?
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
[as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
I didn’t really see a better parking spot. [drives into the dug grave] Whoa! Look what I did. It’s a rental. [Dwight approaches and hugs him] You wanna go in? [both attempt to put the other in the dug grave]
[upon seeing Todd Packer enter the office] Oh, gosh.
Hey, Moonface. Nice to see those shiny, little Chinese eyes of yours.
Packer, we accept. [others disagree]
Todd, you’re just saying insults in the form of an apology.
Huh. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? [hands cupcake to Erin] There you go.
Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don’t eat the cupcake.
We are here today to join this woman and the ground. Man is born of woman and his life is full of turmoil.
[gathers and tastes soil] Huh. It’s crap soil. Nothing’s going to grow here.
Yeah, well, I’m just saying it’s garbage soil, that’s all.
Well, the only thing we’re planting here is dead bodies.
It’s fine ’cause they’re not going to grow.
Well, thank god they’re not because we don’t want to make zombies.
Good. I agree. Don’t worry about it. You won’t get any.
Would the family care to say something?
You had black hair and then gray hair.
You were the aunt to my cousins. Most of your life you were 5’4”, at the end you were 5’1”.
[approaches and hugs Dwight] I see you started without me.
You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?
[to his nephew Cameron] Hello, little man. Haven’t seen you in a few years. [after a weak handshake] What is this? Oh, god. [after a truck with many girls in the bed pulls up] Henry.
Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
This was on the way. We’re going into town after. I need yarn.
Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
We’re at a funeral. There’s a funeral going on here.
Land size? [all shake heads] [removes hat] Shirley, at 1600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area. Sharing borders with six other farms. Including my own farm. And your nephew Dwight’s. [replaces hat] OK. [drives away]
[approaches Fannie, offering a shotgun] Would you want to do the honors?
Oh, right. Uh, you know, I don’t think we have to do this.
[after Dwight opens coffin and begins firing into it] That’s it for me. [exits]
I don’t think we should eat Packers’ cupcakes. We can’t give him the satisfaction.
I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they’re dense. But, they’re also really fluffy.
We can’t let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?
$3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen.
I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That’s rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that’s why I’m an accountant.
Hey, man. I don’t think we’ve met. I’m Clark.
Oh. I’m Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat, little runt earlier.
No? Wow. I’m in this mode now where I’m apologizing for thoughts that are in my head. [Clark fake laughs] Hey. I have a crazy feeling [hands Clark a cupcake] that you are really gonna like this.
Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven’t we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did fire him.
I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong.
Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?
They do. It’s awful. And, it’s getting worse every day.
So, it really is just about the cupcakes.
Wow, you’re right. It is just about the cupcakes.
So, we’re all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
[on a recorded video] Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life’s big sunset, I can’t help but wonder where it all went wrong. You’ve all disappointed me greatly. Fannie. A single mamma in the city.
After I left the army, I bought a 9-acre worm farm from a Californian. Turns out “worm” means something else out there. And, I am now in the business of… pain management. Or, the smoking of pain management.
I can’t stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could’ve grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.
We can’t just sit by and watch our family farm disappear. So, here are my terms. Dwight, Fannie, Jeb. If you come back home, I will leave you my farm. So, there, you have it.
Is she crazy? [as Dwight considers] Dwight?
Let’s do this. Let’s run Aunt Shirley’s farm. I’m in. Boom.
No, no, no. I’m not moving back here. Are you crazy?
Look. I, I don’t want to be mean or like insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it’s just that farm life lacks a certain… sort of sophistication.
That Cammy and I are drawn to. And, I don’t know. The men are just… it’s almost like there’s a… a willing ignorance.
Totally. Yep. The people here are like [makes farting sound, laughs] Like a fart. You know what I’m saying? Like a fart?
You know what? Let’s take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley’s offer.
Uh, somehow how I think a couple of nights could hurt.
You will say ‘yes’ on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say ‘yes’, one. Yes.
Growing up with Dwight and Mose was not easy. Uh, Dwight was obviously the cool one. And, Mose was the visionary. Which left me to be the comedian.
Hey, uh, I just wanted to say I’m sorry for screwing you.
[while Kevin stares at his cupcake] Kevin, you can do this.
Kevin, um, let’s think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?
Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
Hey, you know what? It was, uh, great to see you all again. Take care. [exits]
Guys, I’m proud of us. I think we did the right thing. [after noticing Angela easting cupcake] Hey!
No, no. It’s the principle of the thing.
[exits office, chewing] Oh my god. I forgive him so much. [Kevin begins making choking sounds] Whoa, is he choking?
[after long choking and refusing help from Meredith] Oh, that was fantastic.
[after following Dwight to the chicken coop, before sunrise] Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them?
Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
I was just asking you something I didn’t know.
Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you’re gonna get made fun of a little bit.
[after grabbing an egg] Are we gonna eat these today?
This? No. That’d be cool, though. It’s for milking.
Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
[after seeing Dwight smelling milk] What are you doing now?
Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn’t your father teach you anything?
Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn’t know, it’s OK.
I don’t care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet.
I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night.
Last night? Oh, god, um, I don’t know. [cuts to him arm wrestling Kevin] Na, nothing really. Kevin?
I’m not, a… I’m just. I don’t know. [cuts to him spinning a plate like a record and Kevin dancing] Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um. [cuts to he and Kevin sitting on a table touching each others face] Pretty normal night.
[he and Andy embrace each other in tears] My night was just like that. [cuts to him and Andy trading clothes] Meaning normal.
Yeah. I didn’t see you last night at all. [cuts to him dancing by prostrate Kevin]
Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand.
So, that’s it. I just wanted to make amends. [slides cupcakes across table to Darryl and Jim]
That’s big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.
Oof. This is no nine-acre worm farm. This is a beast. Whoever’s managing this thing is gonna have a hell of a job. Not it.
It. [to Fannie] That kid doesn’t put in some farm time, he’s gonna stay like that.
[Phyllis rocks her chair into his provocatively] Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It’s officially a hostile work environment.
Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it’s not OK to do this in public.
Be careful. I pulled my mom’s dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.
Just ignore her. Sooner or later she’ll finish.
Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.
Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
He- he can’t do that.  Turns out she’s allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal.  It doesn’t become a violation until she physically acts on it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?
She’s listening to 50 Shades of Grey.
Well there you go. That’s muy caliente.
OK, you are useless. I’ll take care of this. [walks out of Andy’s office and dumps water on Phyllis]
It’s OK guys, she’s no longer horny.
Excuse me, dirty birdie [takes Phyllis’ iPod]
You can have this back at the end of the day.  [cut to Andy listening to the iPod and looking aroused, water is dumped on him] Oh!!
Clark, I need your advice. I’m having some lady troubles.
Esther Ruger. [Angela makes a face in the background]
Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.
Well, we’ve been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air.
Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I’m so glad you found someone. I bet she’s got kind eyes.
Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  She’s coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe she’ll be pulling the horse cart! [laughs]
[on phone] Cici has been calling me ‘Pamela’. Like four times this week.
I wonder if she’ll start calling you ‘Jim’.
Oh boy, please don’t. Let’s not let that happen.
What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
You’re- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?
Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies’ first baseman.
Yeah. So, uh, I’ll uh, talk to you later?
[Meredith laughs] What’s going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
There’s a promo for the new documentary on the web.
Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.
[Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction]
Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
[Pam smiles as she watches the promo with her and Jim on the roof] Oh my god, is that you and Jim?
Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really? [laughs] Yikes. That is awful.
Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing. “Banjo at 0:19 is aight” Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy.  I mean that’s the guy’s name, right? ChobbleGobbler?
Hey man, how you doin’? Jim Halpert.
Hey there, Ryan. Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh. [to camera] Eat Fresh.
Esther’s on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let’s see, I know she likes apples and carrots.
I bet she does.  I bet she’ll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they’re from the forest where we harvest our paper.
Fine office you have here. Sturdy walls.
Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always.
Thank you. [Dwight kisses her forehead]
I guess men find Esther attractive.  I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that….thing.
Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.
[eating soft pretzel] We’ve all changed.
With our firm, you’ll be building equity for long after they’ve retired your number.
And we all know, baseball does not last forever.
I look at these actors on TV and I think: “C’mon, I can do that.”
Watch this: Eat Fresh. Now what does that make you think of?
How? I didn’t say Subway sandwiches. It’s called playing the subtext.
I actually wrote a screenplay, it’s called “The Big Piece”
Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it’s autobiographical.
Half biopic and half superhero movie.  A mild mannered professional baseball player, Ryan Howard-
-hits a home run into outer space. Ball comes back with space dust on it, which transforms him into: The Big Piece.
I actually brought a- some copies of my script if you guys wanna read it together.
Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood. [Ryan Howard pulls out 3 thick scripts] Alright.
Andy, are there documentary groupies?
A little ironic that I’m going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel [groups groans] was based on a murdered TV star. The small screen-
Hey guys, I just found another promo. It’s in Danish. I guess it’s gonna start airing in Denmark.
What was that word they said when they showed me “Skrald mand”? What’s that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up]
What? Why would they…wait a second, wait a second! What was that? [pauses on her and Dwight leaving the warehouse area where they’ve just had sex] Oh! I didn’t know they were filming then!
It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn’t know it?
Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified]
There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.
Are you kidding me? It’s like half the show is secret footage.
I am a very private person. I show ’em when I wanna show ’em. Who wants a taste? [lifts shirt to flash camera] Boob sauce!
Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we’re sleeping?
Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we’re sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
I’m sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
I have been very honest with you guys.  In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine.  You’re not going to use any of that, are you?
People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon says: “You guys are killing it!” I mean, we’re internet sensations guys!
I think we need to figure out what’s going on. I might just take a little walk.
Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something]
We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar.  Did they film that?
My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I’d get more [Angela and Oscar make disgusted faces] I thought I’d get more screen time than anyone.
Ok, Pam. Why don’t you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired? Find out what they got.
Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me.
She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
Whoa! Whoa! OK, so what’s this lever do?
That manipulates the secondary shaft.
Oh, the secondary shaft. Eeeh, oooga! [laughs]
The lift capacity’s up at two thousand pounds. That’s a lot of beets.
Let’s talk terms. If you agree to a forty sixty split on this tractor, I’ll store it in one of my barns.
Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I’m interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.
Ok ok ok, wait! You win. [shakes hands]
You would be a great one to buy an auger with.
[on phone] Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring.
Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
What? Don’t you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you’ve got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
These chicks are way too hot to be into us.  Esther’s just pretending to like you so that you’ll buy her daddy a new tractor.
Yes. Her sister’s trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.
What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
No woman would ever want a man who doesn’t know what an auger is.
I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me. [grabs Clark]
Hi, um. I’m sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?
No, no, please, yeah, come on in. It’s good to see you. Sorry, my place is usually not this-
Yeah, no, I- actually it’s always like this. [laughs] Do you want to go outside? It’s a little less cluttered out there.
OK. [Goes out onto terrace] Oh wow, you have a nice view.
Alright, that’s for you. [hands her beer]
[Plays boom box to drown out sound] Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?
They caught us kissing on Halloween.
Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! [Slaps Oscar]
Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy!
Oh! [slaps him again] Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
Well, I don’t like giving him bad news.
Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.
See all this like old stuff, like um, there’s that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?
Oh yeah, that was, that was a good moment.
Yeah, and there’s this one when we were listening to music and it’s like, it’s like w were in love and we didn’t even know we were in love and it’s…but- Do you think Jim’s changed?
I’m sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-
I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he’s- I just feel like…he’s so into his work right now and….I don’t know, am I crazy?
Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they’re kinda freaking out. [Brian laughs] Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-
You know, stuff people didn’t intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much.
Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?
They’ve got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so…no if you were around there, they got you.
So we basically had no privacy for ten years.
Oh no, hang on a second. Pam, I’m sorry, I- I- I can explain this so much better.
Look, if you give me a chance I can, I- [Pam leaves] Pam.
“Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.”
That’ll pay for the exploding helicopter.
“Suddenly, the evil thugs break in to the stadium.  The Big Piece hits baseballs at the evil thugs.”
“Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.”
[louder] “Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!”
Yeah, that’s better. A bunch of hot women go: “Oh yeah!”
“Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.”
“They kiss. It is super emotional. Like in Toy Story.”
Wow. I tell you what, it’s really strong. I can’t wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
“Gotta go! Darth Vader’s launching a huge attack.”
Um another thing. I’m gonna need you to get me the rights to Darth Vader.
I don’t know how we’d go about doing that.
Maybe you’re right. Esther’s a ten and the best I’ve ever done is Angela who’s a nine and she rejected me.
A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let’s go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.
Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we’re the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that’s already been rode hard and put away muddy.
Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way.
I don’t know that there’s anything left for us to talk about, Esther.
Look, we’re gonna have the tractor for the same amount of work days but my dad is planning on leasing it to the Vanderkirk brothers on the weekends.
So you’re going to be paying more, but he’s putting on ten times the miles and he’s pocketing a profit behind your back.
You need to tell him you want a deal based on miles or he can just stick that tractor where the sun don’t shine.
That shady grove out by Willard’s pond.
So, you’re fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?
Of course. [laughs] You didn’t just think I was tractor bait, did you?
Hey Dwight, what’s an auger used for?
Post hole digging. [points and laughs with Esther]
[On speakerphone] You’ve reached Senator Robert Lipton, please leave a message. [beep]
Um the documentary’s going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.
Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential.
Hey, I get the sense you’re gonna be outed as gay.
Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn’t tell you about it.
[on video] Hey! TexasPoonTappa and JasonJasonJason and all the rest of you haters out there! Check this out. [plays banjo, screen types out “you suck my nutz” from TexasPoonTappa, camera zooms out to reveal Nellie]
Huh? Yeah, see ya. [sees comment] Oh! What?! [starts crying]
I hope you got sound on everything. I’d love a DVD of that. [at computer opens translator. Types in “Elskere” which comes back as “lovers” Pam smiles]
Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
[growls] I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they’re making me climb Stair Mountain!
Our office has an unusually large number of… unusually large people.
So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in.
I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. There’s a review of the documentary!
I don’t know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, “Red Alert.”
Well, the alert was already set to “Red” because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to “Double Red”?
[drinks a 5-Hour Energy shot and groans]
“The Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton’s own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!”
“In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There’s Kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get.”
What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news…thing.
“Andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy.”
It’s okay. [chuckles] The hell does he know?
“A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent.”
I want you to print that out for me.
Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation’s Lisa Loeb.
“Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.”
I bet it’s Katie Couric. I’ve been saying this for years.
No, I think they mean more like a politician.
[walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can’t you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could’ve met in the lobby. It’s time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
Son, you’ve lost your mind. I’m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
The buyer is your sister’s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that’s an order.
You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.
Your morning 3-by-5. Coming right up.
Well, we won’t be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.
Oh, your mom’s watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? [chuckles] Oh, um, Embassy Suites. “Do Not Disturb” sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor.
Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?
You know, Jim’s kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.
I mean, we’ve having issues. It can’t hurt to talk about them, right?
Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
Sorry. I—no, no, no, what I meant—what I meant actually was—
Oh, yeah, no, it’s okay. I can handle it. Um, so…
You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple’s counseling.
Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren’t in couple’s counseling, are you? Oh, God.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we’re just starting couple’s counseling. Uh, which doesn’t sound any better.
Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So s—hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here.
Yes, it is your mistake. He’s lingering. So annoying. I’m gonna kill him. How can I help? I’m here.
Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I’ll hold. I’m sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye. [hangs up phone]
Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stan closes limo door] Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
Don’t worry. I’ve scheduled a press conference for later today. We just need to face the camera together. A beloved public servant and his devoted wife. And move on.
All right, if I have to be the good wife, I’ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I’m a better wife than that. [sighs]
Andy—[knocks] I need to talk to you.
Yeah, come on in. I’m just on hold with another talent agency. It’s insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there’s more. 251. 252. I can’t even keep up!
Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
[grunts intensely] I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That’s final.
So what I’m hearing you say is, “Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible”?
Yes! I’m sorry I’m being curt, it’s just I’m about to land a top talent agent.
[on the phone] Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.
For five years I’ve held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it’s time for me to just let that thought go. It’s kind of painful, but it’s also freeing in a way. Now it’s all about my instincts.
Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?
Don’t worry, it’s just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It’s just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha—
No, you didn’t. Sick of you and your—ooh—
[falls to the floor with a loud thud]
Man, he’s really in twinkle town now.
Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren’t those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?
Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley’s got way more body fat than they do.
Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. [claps] Grab his feet. [grunts] Let’s go!
He’s like a manatee. Ready? Let’s go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! [Stanley’s head hits the door frame] Oh, God.  No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.
[grunts] Okay, we’re good. We’re good. Let’s go. Push!
Let’s go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
Okay, listen. I’m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I’ve never actually done this before.
Thank you. I mean, I’ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh…
[connect helmet straps around Stanley’s head] That’s about as good as that’s gonna be.
Okay, now here’s the plan. I’m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
I can’t catch him. He’s like, 250 pounds.
You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He’s gonna be moving slowly. It’s only—
It’s 15 feet down, it’s at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it’s like your catching a medicine—
Dude, this size of my haunches— [Stanley’s body slips down the stairs and his head thumps into a wall]
Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.
[slides down the stairs and lands next to Stanley] You okay?
So how does it work? It’s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or…
You’re really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.
He might start by asking each of you, “Why do you think you’re here?”
He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he shouldn’t be rewarded for that.
If I didn’t do certain things without telling Pam, she’d be married to Roy. [chuckles]
I feel like he’s always making these decisions for the family, and then I’m left playing catch-up.
If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I—this will be so huge for our family.
I mean, what’s the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn’t know when it’s gonna end.
That’s kind of an impossible question.
Ooh, there’s Angela! I work with her!
Huh, yeah. [chuckles] I mean, I’m happy Angela’s the first one getting famous, but it’s a little weird, no? I mean, she can’t sing or act, so it’s actually kind of insane, if you think about it.
Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin’ movie star! [kicks trash can]
[on the computer screen] I would just to start by saying that there have been some rumors about my personal life that I would like to settle once and for all. As my long-suffering wife can attest… I am gay.
Senator, were always gay, or did your wife turn you gay?
[on the computer screen] I’ll say it again for mis amigos latinos. Yo soy homosexual.
I once believed that a gay person could be somewhat straight. It wasn’t until my marriage to Angela that I realized how…charmless I find the female body.
There’s someone else I need to thank. His name is Oscar Martinez.
Oscar is the one who opened my eyes to who I really am. For the first time—
Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn’t know, you didn’t know, and you didn’t freaking know. But I knew! [claps]
–with this new self-awareness, I was finally able to find love at long last. With my amazing… Chief of Staff Wesley Silver.
Almost there. Almost there. [opens car door] Okay. We’re running late. Let’s get him inside.
We can’t just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that’s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.
Carla Fern is not just an actor’s agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate.
Oh, no. [chuckles] Well, I have an act. Dog, cat, mouse.
Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?
If started by accident as these things tend to do. You know, I was setting down my cat, and I accidently put her on top of my dog, and I was, like, so mad at myself at first. And then I was, like, wait. Wait a second.
Does anything go on top of the mouse?
Eh, you know, it really doesn’t make sense to name the mice. They’re kinda like cannon fodder, you know? You’re not one of those PETA guys , are you? [cat jumps off dog] Oh, great.
Hey, wait, wait, how—how are we doing this?
Well, I’ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
Just say “arms” and “legs,” okay? That just—that’s the vernacular that I’m comfortable with.
Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he’s slouching. Okay, can you—sl-slouch him into the seat. [sighs] Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt. [grunts]
[grunts and closes car door] Get in the back.
Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we’re about to do?
Okay. We, hey—hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?
Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we’ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
Isn’t the client, like, best friends with his sister?
I’m sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don’t want him to do it anymore, and I don’t want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.
Well, if Pam says she won’t go, then—[chuckles] we’re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
Well, they deserve each other, then.
And for—oh, whoopsie daisy. [chuckles]
He’s fine. He gets carsick really easily.
It’s a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we’re talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
That’s Benji. Oh, he’s precious. That’s a healthy-looking baby.
Look at him. I’ve never seen such a beautiful child.
Funny sense of humor. If you push on his nose, he’ll go, “eee.”
[Australian accent] Well, what can’t I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn’t noticed, I’ve got a pretty good British accent.
At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here.
Why do you have, uh, a high school musical here on your resume? What are you, like, 40? 45?
My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal’s going out on.
Gyllenhaal, got it. Can you juggle and crap?
Would you dress up as, say, a birthday clown and go to a kid’s party, let ‘em throw pies at ya?
Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. [sniffs] I’m all for it.
Well, Mr. Bernard, I’m gonna be honest with you.
Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.
Uh, no. We’re—we’re gonna take you on as a client.
You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me.
We are extremely excited to be working with you too, sir. Pay Todd on your way out.
Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots.
Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though.
So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?
You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn’t even know it. I’ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. [chuckles] Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.
Oh, no, I’m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.
[stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground]
[stomps on the ground] We need a winch and a hoist.
Quater finals in an hour.  Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight.
I did. I got some really good sleep.
Did you? [pushes pencil cup at Erin]
[grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz.
Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep. [Pam’s plane hit Toby in the eye]
I didn’t see you! You should have yelled “Crossing!”
We are now down to an elite eight.  Well, seven and Toby.
[Reading from script] Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid!
It does not say dangerous. And there’s no exclamation point.
Well I’m just trying to bring some life to it.
Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. [moves to lift Toby’s eye patch] Uggggh! I can’t even, I’m so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go.
Alright, it’s getting gooier so we’ll just do it later.
Yeah, Ok. [Closes door] Alright. Where were we?
And remember:  Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame.
[claps] That was great man. Alright, I’m out of here.
W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don’t go anywhere.  I just need to find more colors. Let’s do it six more times.
Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other’s sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam’s been doing to run the house while I’m in Philly.
And we’re also supposed to speak our truths.
Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn’t have had this opportunity for couple’s therapy.
Oh, we’re supposed to call everything we don’t want to do “opportunities.”
Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let’s get it done tomorrow.  Carla Fern got me a gig.
Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she’s my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I’m just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator.
Why wouldn’t you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds.
Who’s pumped for the quarter finals, huh?
Alright. Sounds like somebody wants to walk away with this. [holds up large check for $2,000]
Nellie you didn’t tell us we could win money.
Oh yes I did, I told you all. It was..um, cause that’s an awful lot of money for me to forget.
Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense.
Nellie, this is a competition.  Please take it seriously.
Oh please. [Dwight watches Angela folding paper airplane]
I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn’t take it. And if I went back now, when I’m broke and he just inherited a farm, I’d be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
Hey. Why don’t you back off?[looks at Pete]…I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I’m kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan’s pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
Are you in that paper documentary too?
No. He’s- I mean, you’ve never acted in anything before. He’s just my entourage.
That’s the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says “action.”
Hey, I made them get you a chair.  All my clients sit.
I guess it’s starting. Um, yeah.  Of course. Yeah sure.  Tell you what. I’ll put my arm around you and then I can take it-
We just need a picture of the top of your head in case we burn some of your hair off.
Got it. [lowers head to show hair, but keeps looking up just as she tries to take the picture]
No, if you could just keep it down until..
OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela.
Hey, that is a really nice plane.  You make that yourself?
Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it’s in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
It’s a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
Ok, that’s enough.  This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one.
I can’t. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn’t noticed.
I’m not giving up.  I’m going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.
Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn’t out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March.  There’s a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.
[Happily] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death.
Ok, um, stop. Um, why are you smiling so much?
Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job.
Ok, well maybe no smiling on this one.
So how do you want, how should I do it?
I don’t know, just like you’re reporting the news or something. Ok?
[ridiculous news voice] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols.
Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]
Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
We’ve still gotta work together, so we should keep it civil.
[Snorts and grunts] I can’t hear what you said. [snorting, grunting] You got your slop? [Squeals]
You know what, this is completely unnecessary.  You already won…
No you can’t baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck.
Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals.
What are you- [Esther kisses him] You’re here early.
Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast cause I knew I was seeing you tonight. There might just be a little feather in your nuggets or a little bit of meat inside of your pillow.
I like a little feather in my nuggets. [both laugh]
Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars.
Ok here you have just knocked over the beaker, the chemicals splashed in your eye.
And I’ve already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain.
That’s great. So what you’re gonna do then is come over here to the eye washing station and then just kinda flush out your eyes.  You know, get the chemicals out. Alright?
So I just lean over this thing and then you’ll add the water special effect later?
Yeah, yeah just hold your lids open with one hand and let the stream bathe your eyeballs.
I’m not comfortable doing my own stunts. I’ll get nude if you want me to, I’ll go full Lena Dunham but I-
Dude, we don’t need you to go nude, OK? So just do the eyewash, Ok? That’s all we’re asking.
Hold up, I’m looking at my spit with a microscope.
They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene.
I can’t squirt stuff in my eyeball.  I’ve never even used an eye dropper.
So Andy, so you know how to use this.  You step on the pedal, water squirts in your eyes.
It is time for a little T & A. I give you: Toby and Angela.
[throws plane far] Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it’s your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.
[to Dwight] Is there a reason that we’re excited for that little woman?
Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
In a way.  But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
[grabs Andy by the cheeks] Andy! If you don’t stick your eyes in that machine, I’m going to call every production in North Eastern Pennsylvania.  You won’t even make an appearance on a security camera! [Andy starts to cry]
She yelled at me. I can’t wash my eyeball. I can’t do that. I can’t.
Andy Bernard can’t squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn’t freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
[throws plane far] Yeah! Ok! Beat that! [Erin throws plane, loses, Dwight laughs] Whoo! Ok.
Sorry I’m mad! I don’t like losing! I thought I was going to win!
Ok [tries to help her] Hey hey hey, whoa.
Sorry. Sorry. I’m going to go upstairs and just…
Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.
Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim’s phone rings, he answers]
Hey that’s work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
Uh, to speak my truth, I’d appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. [Jim hangs up phone] I appreciate the sacrifice.
Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that’s a little unfair.
Really? I’ve been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That’s really your truth?
Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.
I wish we’d started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so… blocked up.
The Mark 47 is ready for launch. [throws plane but it sticks to his hand] Less paste.
[doing eyewash] AHHH! AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!!
And cut. We can fix the sound in post.
I said I can do a better one. Darryl…
Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes.
Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god!
Angela’s first throw, terrible. Dwight.
[fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how’d that happen? God. [Angela smiles]
We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It’s such a pity. Use the money wisely. [Angela looks disgusted]
Don’t you dare tank this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]
And we have a winner. And it’s Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over.
Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it’s me.
[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don’t need pity and I don’t need charity. I have my dignity and that’s enough. And as long as I have that, I’ll be ok.
I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we’re making progress. So I’m really sorry that I have to go but let’s keep at this. Ok?
Ok. [intense moment where Jim leaves and Pam seems conflicted.  She notices his umbrella and runs out to follow him]
Hey! [Runs after her and looks into her eyes] I… [hugs her tightly, Pam doesn’t hug back]
The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
But that doesn’t matter. This does. It’s the only thing that matters. We’ve had some really nice days together.
Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent’s putting me up for a furniture commercial.
Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what’s up? Back in the small pond?
For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin—
Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can’t give 100% to two things at once you know.
Tell me about it, you know? I’ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don’t know if I’m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.
Huh. Well, you know, you can’t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what’s most important. That’s my new thing.
[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
Two sacks’ worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
That’s—that’s awful, Angela. I’m so sorry.
It’s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She’s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
And they’re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and—
Smasher? No, where’d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city’s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
Ah! [throws punch] That’s how it’s done.
Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said “is Indian” and was like, “Is Indian what?” Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
Lately, I’ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy’s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
Yes, there’s Andy! Andy is in. I’m a good receptionist, I know he’s in.
David Walrus, in his native habitat.
Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?
I’m gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.
So you think you’ve been too focused on your job?
At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany.
So you—you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?
Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don’t—it just… I owe it to myself and my future fans.
Uh, well, I guess I can’t stand in the way of a man’s dream. And it seems like you have the gift.
There’s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?
Nope. I have made up my mind. I’m really sorry.
I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.
Oh, Clark. I’m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
Right. Yeah. But, you know, I’ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I’ve earned this. I mean, you know?
You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I’m here.
Right. Well, I’m here to sell paper.
it’s okay. You can sit in the annex.
Okay. The annex it is. I’ll be sitting at your desk if that’s okay with you.
That’s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete’s beautiful, dead eyes.
Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I’m taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.
I can’t say we didn’t see it coming. But it’s a sad day when anybody is fired. We’re so sorry, Andy.
I wasn’t fired. What are you talking about? I’m fired up, yes. Guys, I’m—I’m leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.
Yeah, so, I’ll see you on the red carpet. See, that’s how it works.
Andy sings beautifully. And he’s really good at dancing. He’s a good speaker. But there’s just something there you don’t want to look at.
Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
It’s cool, man. I’m sure you and I will have our own thing.
Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don’t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
I just think you’re going into this a little fast.
I’m 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?
Show business is cold. Let’s say you get a job, which you probably won’t. They’re not gonna cut you any slack. You’re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
[hugs Darryl] I’m gonna miss you too. Mmm!
Andy’s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don’t know. You know who’s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can’t fly right. I’d pay to see him. But I don’t have to cause the park is free!
I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts.
He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
It’s not a large room, I think they heard me.
Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]
That’s really ok. I’m mostly focused on the belt here.
Just slip it off my—Slip it off my hips.
Hold it—Take a step back. Take a step back. [they bow, then Dwight thrusts again] Okay, okay. I can’t—I can’t do this if you’re gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think we’re gonna have to cut this off.
He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You’re gonna watch me right?
Yes, I will. [Dwight starts doing karate]
Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?
Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but Dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world.
He said that? He’s an odd guy, isn’t he?
Yes. Irritating, also yes. But I gotta hand it to him, he’s one of the most tenacious and determined men I’ve ever met. [Dwight finishes his routines and everyone applauds]
Oh! I’m am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue.
I really felt like I almost lost her, and—and nothing is worth that.
Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn’t even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.
Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.
You did not just say that! You don’t know Pam. She is really cool.
All I’m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager’s chair. And I thought you wanted that job.
Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It’s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I’d be happy to see Jim as manager.
So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.
Again! And I’m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?
You’re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh—
Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don’t want to meet that person.
Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.
Well, it’s better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?
Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and “full-ass” it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?
Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You’re too character-y to be a lead and you’re not fat enough to be a great character actor.
No, I don’t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can’t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
If you could help me out, that would be—
I could give you some beginner stickies?
Oh, also, while you’re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It’s really great.
Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager’s job?
No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
Yeah, right. I’m afraid that ship has sailed.
I wouldn’t be too sure about that. Just saying.
You know, I don’t know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog’s outta here, so letting it all hang out!
This is exciting! You’re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
Thank you, I appreciate that. ‘Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.
Oh, I doubt you’ll make it. Very few do who’ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you’ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.
Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don’t quit your day job.
[cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.
I’m gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.
Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That’s something you can’t take back.
So true. Is there a question, or are—what?
Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?
Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
Thank you. [steps into conference room]
You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.
Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?
Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let’s go. It’s good news.
I’m sorry. I’ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.
But this isn’t interim manager. No. It’s Dwight K. Schrute… [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.
In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.
I know, Dwight. I know. [reaches out to shake Dwight’s hand, Dwight hugs him] Okay. Okay. All righty. You’re gonna do great.
I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
I’m sure you did not. What was your question?
I don’t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.
Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I’m waiting.
Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I’m gonna stay on in sales.
Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.
Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don’t want to see you in a porn next year.
Ooh, there’s a great play about a salesman.
Sure, ‘Death of a Salesman’ by Arthur Miller, it’s a great play about crushed dreams.
No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
[sits at Dwight’s desk] Got any hot leads?
See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.
I had no idea. And here I’ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin’ sheep.
I’m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it’s like a double date.
Wow. Cause, uh [gestures to him and Erin and then to Pam and Jim with sound effects]
Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That’d be fun.
Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.
Oh, well, Thursday’s tough, because of—
Weeknights are actually tough just because—
Just forget it. Forget I said anything.
Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute—
David. Can I just do one thing while you’re making this announcement and then I’ll never, ever do it again?
It’s just one thing. Just let me—let me do this—
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on—what I was about to say was Dwight—[phone buzzes] Oh, I’m sorry, I gotta—This’ll be a second, sorry.
[on phone] Then we’ll get him a new set of drums.
[climbs up on desk] Dwight Schrute is manager! [everyone cheers and applauds]
[from atop his desk] Creed Bratton is the new manager! [nobody responds]
Dwight’s the new manager. He freaking did it.
[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, Dwight.
[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, buddy.
You’re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we’ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
I wanted to offer you a new position.
Nope. Can’t accept that job. It’s not a real job.
I’ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I’d be proud to take.
Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
Don’t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
Hey, I didn’t get a chance to say it, but… congratulations, Dwight.
Yeah, and Dwight, I’d like to be the first to say congratulations.
Uh, dream. Goin’ with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn’t that right, Jim?
Oh, don’t look at me cause I think you’re making a terrible choice.
Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.
Yeah, but here’s the thing. I can’t have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I’ll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.
Andy, you know I can’t do that. It’d be lying.
All right, fine, just know that you made me do this. [starts touching Toby’s thighs]
[fending Andy off] Oh, come on. Andy, no.
God, Toby, don’t—stop blocking my hand.
Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!
David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I’d just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite.
We put the past behind us, though, Andy.
What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?
Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?
Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don’t squash my knickety-knacks on top.
Yeah, okay. That’s not what I mean. You don’t have to leave because you said you would. Don’t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It’s not worth it.
Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too—
But I just—it’s in the past. And I feel like we shouldn’t…
Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.
You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
Tuna, I’m a performer. And perform I shall. [sings ‘I Will Remember You’—everyone is slightly impressed]
[crying] It’s just a really nice song.
Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He’s not terrible.
Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
Wait a minute. You’re not thinking of living in a—
Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
Okay, I’m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won’t be long. It’s the least I could do.
You’re welcome. Let’s go get Phillip. Then we’ll get your stuff…
And get you the hell outta that place.
Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What’s up?
We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it’s not just a Philly play, so get this: they’re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
Yeah, we did. Hey, how long—how long do we think that’s gonna take?
Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.
So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
No, it’s neat and tasteful, like most gay men’s homes. The stereotype holds up.
I wouldn’t know. I never lived with a gay guy.
I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You—you can’t—
But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
No, I meant you’re getting colder. The correct response is, “the coffee in Peru is much hotter.”
But, that’s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?
It’s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I’d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
[while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
[carrying in clothes on hangers] Oh, I’m saving a fortune on dry cleaning.
Angela’s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it’s Angela who’s living in the closet. Hey-o.
Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that’s premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick.
Ok, thanks. Go ahead and get in the back of the line.
You know what to do. [waits for Jim to put form in inbox, signs it and returns it to outbox] Ok
Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we’ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War—
Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.
All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.
When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he’s giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he’s certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.
Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. “Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.” [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
Let’s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you’re expecting a fax today, please don’t yell out, “Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.” Ok? That’s nonsense.
We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they’re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, “Nice jugs”?
That’s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
[overlapping] Zero. No nonsense. You can’t have nonsense.
[as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?
Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won’t forgive. So, hi.
Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who’s excited?
I’d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I’ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn’t for the cameras, I would’ve done some truly vulgar crap.
Over the course of this documentary I’ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble: my wife did it.
I’m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
I can’t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.
This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang “I Dreamed a Dream” from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.
Whoo-hoo! Casey Dean! Cincinnati, Ohio! [singing] Doctor, doctor, gimme the news, I got a great Casey Dean for you.
No, this is my time! You don’t belt on my time! I belt on my time.
Why didn’t you pack the apple snacks?
Why didn’t you pack the apple snacks?
Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says “bold front” instead of “cold front”? It’s insane.
Not now, Kevin. Can’t you see we’re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
Seriously, Kevin. I’m just gonna have to go to the store.
Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It’s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy—
Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]
My god, I’m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
I’m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You’ve got a regional manager.
Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.
But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
I’d have to get some more wire and string, but it’s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
Yeah, right. I mean, unless they’re willing to pass some tests.
I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
That doesn’t sound crazy, Jim. That’s the sanest thing I’ve ever heard.
Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.
A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.
What’s up, everybody? And welcome to America’s Next A Cappella Singing Sensation!
Ah! It’s Mark McGrath! Oh my god! You’re gorgeous!
Oops. I’m not supposed to—I’m not supposed to say that. All right, no mole. Forget I said it, all right?
What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.
Good man right there. I’ll see you guys inside. Good luck, all right?
Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.
Yeah, you made a personal connection with him.
We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
You’ll always have the upper hand, when you’ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that’s for fueling only. No savoring.
You don’t need to repeat right now, when I’m saying it.
By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
What’s going on? How was the delivery?
Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I’m here.
I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other’s minds. You’re trying to give your wife this job.
That’s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna—
Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?
[reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.”
No, no, no, no! You don’t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There’s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don’t have diplomatic relations.
I just hope that if my buddies who are still in Afghanistan see me win, they’ll feel like anything is possible.
Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.
Over at the porta-potties, they were interviewing a homeless, single mother with three kids.
Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
I don’t know. But I’m getting really worried here.
They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
Cool, are you coming back to say hi?
No, no, I’m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn’t say goodbye to.
We livin’ like rock stars. I’m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
Wow. Man. I hope he doesn’t regret it.
Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.
Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
Yeah. It’s real. It’s the only way you’ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She’s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
[over Jim] No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?
[running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here’s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing—none of these people are good enough.
What I’m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I’ve ever said.
Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That’s it. You look really, really good.
Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
No, I know that you’re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
Because I’m so glad you’re back, baby, but I’m just—I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you’re giving up so much.
I’m afraid that you’re gonna resent me and I’m afraid that—
This is not enough for you and I’m afraid that I’m not enough for you.
Not enough? I don’t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it’s against the rules but I’m gonna need a favor from you guys.
I didn’t realize we were this close.
We’re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
Are you gonna come to Poor Richard’s and watch with us tonight?
These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he’s gone for who knows how long.
Did we ever have lunch together, just—just the two of us? You know what, I’m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino’s.
Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.
Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl’s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we’ll get this started.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that’s on me. But I’m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you’re feeling sentimental.
Hey, hey, hey. I’ll do one thing with y’all.
I don’t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]
What? I’m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
No, I don’t need this! And you obviously don’t need me.
Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
He just won’t go down. It’s as if he’s excited by all this paper.
I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
Smart baby. That’s the most flavorful bond.
Hey, what’s goin’ on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young’uns?
You did a really great job. You even look shorter.
Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.
All day long, it’s moo the cows and cluck the hens. Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs.
Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]
Dwight, I’m telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight?
The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
[puts his grandmother’s ring away] Thank you, Esther.
You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I’m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don’t worry, he’s the best in the biz.
Unless you think he can’t handle it.
[holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley’s sleeping. You don’t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there’s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
Well, he’s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager’s office before?
Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It’s called “Schrute or Consequences.” You’re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you’re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
Sorry, folks, the judges are totally swamped. We are all done taking auditions.
But thanks for coming out and be sure to watch America’s Next A Cappella Sensa—
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can’t do that. You can’t do that, we’ve all been waiting.
I’m not touching you. Okay? [Andy makes a break for it]
Run, old man! Run! Run! Run for your life! Get off. Don’t you dare. Don’t get—I could see it. You were gonna get handsy with me. Not interested. I’m Casey Dean! You’ll be seeing the last of me. Er, I meant you won’t be seeing the last of me!
Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don’t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he’s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
He’s not that smart. He doesn’t know where I hid his duck.
[interrupting contestant singing “Beautiful” by Christina Aguilera] Hi. You’re still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You’re like, my three favorite people ever.
No, you’re a middle-aged man with a lot of makeup on.
Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.
No, we do not want to hear you sing.
Gabriella was our last audition. Thank you. Goodbye.
Nope! Can’t end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss’s car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.
That’s—that’s what—yeah. Okay, all right, well, here’s the song. [singing] Far above Cayuga’s waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater—
Are you insane? It’s the Cornell fight song.
Listen, all right, thank you very much, we’re not interested.
You didn’t let me finish. That’s not fair.
Look, man, you’re not terrible. We’ve heard a lot of really good singers today and you’re just not good enough.
Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that’s the show. Let me try a different song, okay?
[singing] Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you’re never fully dressed without a smile. [falters at the judges’ reactions] Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly—
Look, you gotta go. [Andy falls to his knees, sobbing] You can’t just sit here and cry.
[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.
Can’t hear you. I’m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
Okay, I guess, it’s just that Phillip got you something.
It’s just his way of saying, “Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.”
Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That’s Kevin.
So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we’re gonna be best friends. He’s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we’re gonna do this right.
Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer]
I am sorry he’s here today but I had—
Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let’s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man’s closet.
If he is your son, that’s a great plan. But he’s not. He’s not your son.
Well I’ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn’t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.
Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
OK, I don’t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
Ok, um, this is… [leaves DVD with her]—I’ll be right back.
I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
Wow! Congratulations, that’s a really big step.
Right in the sweet spot. I think you’re gonna be really happy.
Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
That’s very true. Get the hell outta here.
Well, then I guess you’re ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]
It’s from the teapot. Everything you’ll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.
Hit it, red! [“Boogie Wonderland” by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]
I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I’m gonna miss these guys.
See you guys at Poor Richard’s, all right?
Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother’s, and I’ll meet you at Poor Richard’s in an hour.
Are you sure you don’t want me to drop him off?
She doesn’t know I’m living with a straight woman. I don’t want to get her hopes up.
All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye!
What do you—Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over]
[getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem!
Listen to me! I love you! And I don’t care that Phillip’s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
This expresses how loudly I love you.
[puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
Okay, yes—yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor’s up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. [Dwight kisses Creed’s head] Oh!
You have to change the channel to PBS.
But there’s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
How many people want the game? [half the bar cheers] Who wants PBS? [other half cheers] Sorry. Tie means I do nothing.
Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
One more for the doc. [the office staff cheers]
Hey, how was the singing show audition?
No one is ready for this. You can’t be ready for this. We don’t even know what this is.
One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of “Pilot”]
PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
[mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
Ah, I’ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is…for…Kevin.
Go ahead and just read the frosting.
It’s a colloquial way of saying “you’re fired,” Kevin, which you are.
Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone’s ever been fired, Toby’s blocked it, so…
Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here’s your cake.  [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.
I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it’s good for the environment too.
Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
[whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
[whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She’s disgusting. Those feet. They’re like the paws of an orangutan.
I think she looks good. Now that she’s wearing sports bras, we don’t see her boobs as much.
[after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?
[laughing] To remind you that our wedding’s gonna be wonderful.
Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
D, it’s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he’s been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him.
I think I gained a couple of pounds since I got here.
After 16 years, it’s strange sitting across from somebody who isn’t Stanley. But…he’ll get there.
Okay, the limo’s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready ‘cause I want to pack in a lot.
Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight’s night, okay?
Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won’t be necessary tonight.
Great, now we got three hours to fill.
Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn’t going to show up?
Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he’s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
Mose has been weird? That’s so unlike him.
Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.
Oh, Don’t. Aw, come on, Baby Wawa. Don’t be such a baby.
[crying and pouring eye drops in his eyes]
It’s gonna be all right. For Weekend Update I’m Seth Meyers. That’s Baby Wawa. Good night.
After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. [pause] Not really my scene.
[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby’s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you…hold on.
Hi. I keep seeing this symbol in the accounts from last year. It’s..it’s all over the place. I don’t know what it means.
That’s the reason Kevin got fired. It’s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] “A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.” He was home by 4:45 that day.
Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I’m looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can’t wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone.
How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?
Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?
[alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know ‘cause they have to give you one month’s notice before they leave.
[whispering to Phyllis] That’s Baby Wawa, right? Oh, my God!
Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.
Andy, I’ve been worried about you. How are you?
[struggling] Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis.
Didn’t I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
What? Must’ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um…I didn’t call ‘cause I figured you changed the number.
No I didn’t change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? “Guten Prank” number one.
You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
We’re fine. Yeah. [hugs both Darryl and Andy] And I’m sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn’t you be?
Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How’s the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.
I love it. And it’s Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
Yeah. Yeah, it’s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are…for real.
Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo’s here. Let’s do this. Change if you need to.
Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.
Woah-Oh! Haven’t been in one of these in forever.
They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a cliché. I’m a man. So I’m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn’t on the itinerary.
Jim…wha… Come on! What…what are you gonna whack me, Jim?
No, Dwight. You’ll be doing the whacking.
OH! [all laugh and applaud after Dwight fires the bazooka]
Yeah! [to camera] Guten Prank number two.
Hey, I know you. Are you gonna sit here and cry?
Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
Jim, it’s fine. He’ll just get you on his cell phone and then that’ll go viral.
Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.
That’s how I got my new job in the admissions office.
No. It’s a job. Things are going great.
Whoo-hoo. Let’s get this party started!
[laughs] We’re very close. We even have our own special language.
[sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?
Hey, did somebody order the chef special?
No, we haven’t ordered anything. No one’s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]
Oh, we do. So we’ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
Mm, I know what you want. I know exactly what you want.
Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that’s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
Ohh, shh. [places finger over Dwight’s lips]
Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef’s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won’t work. That’s no good.
Heard you guys needed some pipes fixed or cleaned or whatever.
No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom’s not here.
Give the good show, my little entrepreneur.
Take it off. [music play]. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper’s only as good as his song.
Whoo-hoo…go, Meredith’s stripper son.
Oh geeze. [Jakey starts dancing on Angela]. Oh, my God!
Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela]
Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
[Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It’s o…thank you. You know what? You don’t have to…oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It’s okay.
Now, for the last time, I’d like a side salad with balsamic.
Dwight, for the last time, she’s not a waitress.
If you want her to leave, just tip her.
What for? We haven’t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren’t deep fried, right?
That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?
Okay. [opens door] It’s just the wind, see? Nothing.
Alright, see, you don’t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It’s the wind. Just come and shut…[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!
Oh, man, never thought I’d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]
Oh, it’s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela’s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
Oh, great. He’s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.
A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you’d ever set foot in in this town?
Mm, hey driver. Why don’t you take us to 3030 Adams?
If you want your bride, buy us a drink! If you want your bride, buy us a drink.
Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  [Kevin turns around] Oh.
Well, well, well, well, well, well. That’s six “wells.” Did I get that number right, Dwight?
[to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim]
You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
Nope, not a prank. I think it’s time for you to bury the hatchet.
I heard you say “well” the first time.
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow’s his wedding day. You can’t be anything but happy on your wedding day.
It was nothing personal. It’s just that you were terrible at your job.
You’re just saying that to make me feel better.
No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.
You’ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?
Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk]
What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!
No. We can’t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
Yes, I’m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
Am I the only one that’s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
Doesn’t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
I’m sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.
[watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It’s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
I’ll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. [walks down the hall]
Nard Dog! [cheers and claps] Ree-De-De-De-Doo! [repeats]
How did it feel to see your lives played out on tv?
It’s like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It’s kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn’t wanna know any of it.
With today’s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it’s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So… thanks PBS.
Uh, Jim, that DVD in the last episode was so romantic. And, um, I think we’d all love to know, Pam, what romantic thing did you do to pay Jim back for leaving Athlead?
Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don’t know. I’m working on something.
She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that’s fine.
All I can say is, if I had Jim, he would have a free pass to do anything. I mean if I lucked into that… he could do anything. Anything.
[pause] I’m sorry. Is there a question?
Pam, what was in that teapot letter?
Oh, um, well, you know, I… I just… I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you’d been filmed for nine years of your life, there’d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.
We’re gonna move on. Next question please.
Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody’s actually filming you anymore?
I wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed. Was it accurate?
I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn’t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.
I have a question for Jim and Pam. Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how you’re soul mates. So, Pam, how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia?
Um, you know what, I actually didn’t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
Yes. Um, the thing I found most compelling about the documentary was your search for your birth mother.
So my question is, um, do… don’t you hate her? I mean, I would just imagine that you were so angry at her that you would hate her.
Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug]
Erin… Same question but about your dad? [they hug]
Jeff Bomondo. I sell ceramic tile out of Newark.
My wife’s name is Kathryn. I can show you my social security card if it helps.
Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.
Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]
That is an amazing name. I’m obsessed with Drake. His last album… it just touched me to pieces.
No Kelly, he’s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It’s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I’m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
They’re called premature, sweetie. It’s good to see you again Ryan.
Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.
No, my heels aren’t too high. It’s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn’t know. As long as I can get to the altar.
Oh, I’m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
[chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars]
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um… I don’t know how to tell you this, but… we have a little bit of a problem.
The minister just told me that it’s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
Oh, come on. I’ve never heard of such a thing.
I haven’t heard of it, obviously. But I’m out because I am significantly younger than you-
I think it’s definitely… Well, okay. Either way…
Either way, Dwight… I can’t be there for you. I’m sorry.
I just…really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
[turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can’t believe you came.
As it is traditional to the Schrutes, the lovers are standing in their own graves as a reminder that this is the only escape from what they are about to do.
[to Joan] See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?
I now pronounce you man and wife. [everyone cheers] Release the doves! [doves do not move right away]
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They’ll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab ‘em on in there.
[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don’t owe me anything.
Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he’s hot.
I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
Oh, yeah, you’re not feeling well little guy? Okay, sure. Should we go inside?
Actually, could you go inside? I’m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn’t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
I don’t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn’t look so good.
He’ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He’s allergic but he’ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss]
Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
[with Michael] Oh, my gosh, it’s choreographed!
He just so happy to have a family plan.
Where’d you learn to dance like that?
I don’t know. I’ve just always been really good at dancing.
[dancing with Stanley] I missed you.
Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson’s a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It’s me. It’s me.
Hey, has anyone seen Ryan… or Kelly?
Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
Oh, that’s it. Here. [hands Drake to Kevin] Call child services and report an abandoned baby. We’ll find a better parent than Ryan in no time.
Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will… who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves.
Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]
If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We’ll be somewhere in Europe. [looking at Drake] Won’t we?
[crying] I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It’s every parent’s dream.
The Doc crew’s throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight.
Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?
Oh, I don’t know. I might turn in early.
It’s only 6:00. Come on, everybody’s going.
[sighs] [whispering] Why are you still here?
[whispering] I’m so sorry. They were an hour late.
Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
Well, you… you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.
I promise you, you don’t have to do this for me.
[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about…
Hold on a second. [turning] Wait, what did you just say?
I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I’d love to contribute to your campaign.
Everyone, Let’s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just…I kind of meant just everybody from the office.
[taking pictures] Very nice. Just a couple dozen more. Smiles, everybody, smiles. All right, that’s great. I got enough. Thank you, everybody.
[whispering to Pam] Let’s go outside
Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith’s drawer] What the…there’s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I’m sorry. Jim Halpert doesn’t work here anymore.
If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it’s that if you film anybody long enough, they’re going to do something stupid. It’s only human natural.
Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?
You know what? Maybe we should talk.
Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
[on the computer] You’re probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn…
I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing…
And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We’ll come back to visit. But I think it’s time for us to officially…
No, don’t say it. You’re fired! You’re both fired!
Dwight, come on. Don’t end on a bad note.
Don’t be an idiot. It’s for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you’ve been here. That’s the max.
Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you’re ever in the area, you’ll always have a place to stay…in my barn.
[on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you’re about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.
You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It’s not much. But if you see it in the right way…And that’s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn’t once show me doing my origami.
[walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh!
[playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn’t matter. ‘Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same…
Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
No, but I still have my medal from that.
Oscar. Oscar. [crying] I think I’m gay.
[sniffles] It’s just that I’m so emotional.
Yeah, but you’re not gay. You’re not gay.
[still playing and singing] And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.
How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they’re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You’re not alone sister. Let’s get a beer sometime.
I’m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all…I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There’s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn’t that kind of the point?
